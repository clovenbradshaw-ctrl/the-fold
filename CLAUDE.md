# The Fold — inherited law

This repo does not get to invent its own rules. The canon lives elsewhere and
is read first. This repo's own operating policies — the standing decisions
made under that canon, each with its evidence and its enforcing test — are in
`POLICIES.md` and bind every session working here.

| document | what it governs | path |
|---|---|---|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | what an organ may do, what is legacy, what an amendment costs | `../eo-constitution/` |
| `LAWS.md` | eoWebLLM's laws, L1–L7 — each one a mistake made twice | `../eoWebLLM/LAWS.md` |
| `READING-POLICY.md` | **canonical for how reading works** — P0–P6 | `../eoreader6/` |
| `CUBE.md`, `12-nine-terrains…md` | the nine terrains as a *representation* standard | `../eoreader6/` |
| `SEED.md` | perceive only by difference from a ground you rebuild | `../eoreader6/` |

The rest of this file is the mapping: which law binds which file here, where
this repo already complies, and where it knowingly does not. It exists so the
next pass does not re-derive any of it from scratch — which is what happened
through most of this one, at real cost.

---

## Laws this repo is built on

**L5 — a compliance-critical fact is never left to the model's own
instruction-following.** The load-bearing one. `BASE_PROMPT` asks for an
address after every claim; two models four times apart in size ignored it on
tabular material, zero addresses across six turns. The fix was not a better
prompt: `cite.js` attaches the address mechanically, `grounding.js` checks
every figure and name against the bytes, `tables.js` computes a table the app
already knows the answer to rather than asking for one. **This law was
rediscovered here by measurement before it was read. It was already written
down.**

**READING-POLICY P1 — activation decays, identity does not, recall is
retrieval.** `RECENCY_WINDOW` is the reach of the present, not the size of
memory. A turn that falls out of it is not forgotten; its record is addressed
and re-openable. *Never enlarge the window to fix a recall failure* — if
something is not coming back, the defect is in retrieval or coreference.

**P5.2 — normalize before computing offsets; byte-offset self-verification is
mandatory.** Every chunker here is verified: 121/121 row groups on the MNPD
CSV, 670/670 on the Nashville slice, 11,132/11,132 on War and Peace.

**P5.3 — strip container boilerplate.** Was violated until just now: 47 of
11,190 War and Peace passages were the Gutenberg licence and donation appeal,
fully retrievable and citable. `stripContainer` in `source.js` drops them and
carries the offset forward so addresses still name the file on disk.

**P4 — numbers are declared, gaps are results.** Partially honoured. `retrieve`
has no relevance floor by design; `checkGrounding` distinguishes `examined`
from `clean`; `openQuestions` reports a gap rather than guessing. But
`ROWS_PER_CHUNK`, `NULL_SAMPLES`, `CORPUS_MINIMUM` and `MAX_FINDINGS` are
hand-picked constants that P4 says should be derived from the material. **Open
debt.**

**P5.5 — when a result surprises you, check the driver before the theory.**
Honoured twice: the attribution false-warrant rate was traced to the null, not
to the corpus; the "fix didn't work" was traced to a stale module served from
cache, not to the fix.

**L2 — capitalisation is a differentiator, never the primary signal.**
`cite.js::namesIn` uses capitalisation to find names and then *vetoes* on them;
it never admits an entity on capitalisation alone. `grounding.js` carries the
discourse-adverb stoplist for the same reason.

---

## What this repo may not do

**The cube is not a content classifier.** `packages/engine/operators.js` records
the measurement: 95.7% of cell assignments survived shuffling the words inside
2,527 paragraphs. Deriving a terrain from a passage is a refuted move. The nine
terrains are a representation standard and a dispatch key for verbs — never a
label computed from text.

**Only two of the nine terrains have lenses today** (Entity, Link — referent
identity and modifier scope; `eoreader6/reading/index.js` says so in its own
header). "All the terrains" is not available anywhere, including in eoreader6.
A reading with no lens on a terrain omits it, and that omission must stay
visible — never silently implied as "there is nothing there."

**Nothing is ported from `eoreader4.x`.** Constitution I.2: legacy is frozen
reference; a legacy organ that has not been re-earned does not exist for
placement purposes.

---

## Where the engine already does it

Do not rebuild these. `eoreader6/packages/host/` is the assembled reader:

- `createSession` / `admitChunked` / `ingestFile` — admission, chunked, with
  byte-accurate spans and provenance. Ingests 3.3MB in 8.4s.
- `searchSpans` — retrieval returning `{span_id, source_id, byte_start,
  byte_end, text}`, the same address shape this repo's refs use.
- `sessionReferents` / `sessionRelations` — coreference and relations.
- `executePrompt` (`surfer.js`) — the address ladder SOURCE → HEADING →
  CONTENT → WINDOW, "never fabrication".
- `emergence/surprise.js` — novelty (Shannon surprisal) and Bayesian surprise,
  kept apart, provably identical only at full commitment. This is the measured
  answer to "what is most interesting", and the only licensed one.

One measured gap found while wiring: `searchSpans` does not fold diacritics —
`Natásha` returns three spans, `Natasha` returns zero. This repo's `tokenize`
does fold them. Same bug class, opposite state.

---

## Explore (added 2026-08-16) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

Explore is the data explorer: one source in focus, its surfaces revealed as
plain-named views (source / cast / relations / graph / trace / kinds / gaps /
projections / legend). **The nine-terrain grid never fronts the UI** — the
user refused the 3×3 map ("surfaces should reveal themselves"); the canon
lives in the legend view, typed `received` with its giver.

**Files.** `explore-server.mjs` (port 8812; localhost-only CORS; serves this
whole directory INCLUDING the `/engine` mount serve.mjs has — without that
mount the chat page half-loads and its tab handler silently never binds),
`explore-worker.mjs`, `explore.html`, `explore/explore.{css,js}`,
`explore-bridge.js`, `render.js` (+ tests). Engine work lives in
**eoreader6 `packages/host/terrains.js`** (sessionTerrains / sessionKinds /
kindsNullArm, conformance in `host-terrains.test.js`) — the user's standing
rule is *leave everything you can in eoreader6*.

**The record (FOLD-CONSTITUTION I.5).** `record/explore-record.jsonl`,
append-only: every source open, every job with its declared parameters,
every deposit, every error. Never truncated, never rewritten. Deposits from
Converse land content-addressed in `materials/`.

**Coordinate spaces, never mixed silently.** `b0/b1` = UTF-8 bytes (engine);
`c0/c1` = JS-string chars (chat refs; `readRange` slices the JS string).
`explore.js::byteCharIndex` converts; deep links carry whichever space they
were born in.

**Kinds ship armed.** induceKinds fabricates on structureless material
(eo-evidence: 10% against a registered 5% bar), so every run carries a
per-population null arm (redealt copies, marginals preserved, co-occurrence
destroyed), DEFERRED so the kinds render first as `provisional` and the arm
lands after. Draws are caller-declared; **the renderer may never phrase
finer than the arm's `finestRank`** — the banner sentence is built from
draws/drawsWithKinds, natural-frequency style. Tiny populations return a
typed `refused-as-underpowered` gap, never the engine's raw throw.

**Atmosphere runs at hop = window.** Not an optimisation: the slack-run
null is calibrated at that stride (loops/reading-regime.js: 55–90% false
alarms at stride 1 vs 0–3% at window). hop=1 was the miscalibrated choice —
and also 148s of what used to be a 7-minute read of War and Peace.

**Reads stream.** `sessionTerrains` emits each surface as its organ
finishes, cheapest first (Field ms → Atmosphere ~30s → cast ~88s → graph
~25s on the 3.3MB Tolstoy; admission itself is 8.6s). The worker forwards
each as `reading:<Surface>`; the server accumulates `job.partial`; the page
reveals views progressively. Completed reads are memoized in-memory by
path·mtime·size and reuse is recorded (`read-reused`), never silent.

**Embed contract.** The chat page hosts Explore as a pane
(`pane-explore` → iframe `http://localhost:8812/explore.html?embed=1`,
loading=lazy). Embed mode drops Explore's own chrome; the rail folds behind
☰. Explore → chat crossings are postMessages:
`{type: "fold:material:add", name, path, text}` — the chat side owns the
listener, its sources strip, and mute/unmute. The Material TAB is removed
by user direction (drop-anywhere and paste flows remain).

**Shared-file ownership (multi-session).** `app.js` interior, holon.js,
constitution.js belong to the fold-architecture session — render.js was
built to its contract (block structure only; every inline run through
`decorateInline`; fenced code and tables belong to artifact.js; addresses
`[name#a-b]` are opaque tokens). `.tabs` in index.html is the panel tab
bar; anything header-level must not take that class. Hard rule enforced by
constitution.test.mjs: **no non-localhost host anywhere** — no webfonts, no
CDN, nothing.

The same class then surfaced INSIDE this repo, found by running the
instrument on War and Peace (2026-08-16): `tokenize` folded, so retrieval
found the right chapters, while `grounding.js`'s containment index and
`cite.js`'s name veto did not fold — so Bezúkhov and Hélène, plainly in the
retrieved bytes, were flagged "not in the material" and real attributions
risked the veto. Fixed with one shared `foldDiacritics` (source.js) applied
on BOTH sides of every containment; regression pinned in
`grounding.test.mjs`. The lesson generalizes: every organ that compares text
to text must share retrieval's fold, or a found passage fails the very check
that should confirm it.

---

## The web organ (added 2026-08-16) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

Web search and page reading exist, as P13's one sanctioned egress (POLICIES
P13 amends P1 — read it before touching any of this). The split is strict:
**`web.js` is pure** (extraction, both DuckDuckGo faces, the history fold,
archive-address naming — all tested offline against captured fixtures in
`eval/fixtures/`), **`explore-server.mjs` owns the network** (`/api/web/
search|fetch|history|settings|clear`), and **the browser page still fetches
nothing remote** — `web.test.mjs`'s seam test scans explore.js/explore.html/
explore-bridge.js exactly the way II.13 scans the Converse files. Archive
links in the UI are anchors built from server data, user-followed, never
page-loaded.

**A fetch keeps everything.** Raw bytes AND the extracted readable face land
content-addressed (sha256) in `web/pages/`; the visit lands in
`web/history.jsonl` with its retrieval date. Salience is `foldExtract` over
the whole saved text (kept-of-N declared) — finding what matters never
shrinks what is kept. Saved pages are ordinary sources: opening one from
history runs the full reading pipeline. Re-fetching identical content
stores one copy (content addressing) but each visit is its own history row
— browser-history semantics, except the rows hold the pages.

**history.jsonl is a fold, and clearable.** Append-only in operation (the
deferred archive.org result patches by id — SPN routinely takes a minute
the fetch response must not wait for), clearable by decision (per entry or
all; files deleted only when no kept entry names them). The clearing is a
record event: `web/` is the user's to empty, `record/` is not. web/ is
gitignored like record/ and materials/.

**The UI is the "web" view** (always present, next to "files") — omnibox
(address reads, anything else searches), the archive.org toggle (server
truth, default off), salient-lines card, then history grouped by day:
time · title · host · size kept · archive state · html · ✕. Deliberately
NOT the materials strip and NOT the desk tiles.

**Refusals stay typed** — measured live while building: DDG's anomaly page
→ `refused-upstream`; a proxy's 200 "upstream connect error" body →
off-endpoint (a failed search, never "the web had nothing"); britannica's
Cloudflare "Just a moment..." → `challenge: true` on the entry, bytes still
saved, ⚠ in history. And the extraction lesson: attribute values legally
contain ">" (Wikipedia's data-mw JSON), so every tag regex in web.js walks
quoted values — the naive `[^>]*` leaked half an infobox into the text face.

## The holonic layer, and its one known deviation

`holon.js` runs a task as parts: plan (shape enforced by decoding grammar,
never by instruction), then per part the same organs an ordinary turn uses.
The plan is an append-only log in `task-log.js`'s vocabulary (propose /
supersede / evidence / result / retract; seq not clock; supersession keeps
the past; evidence accumulates from any entry; payload carried through the
fold) — the cube/operator half of that module is deliberately NOT carried:
this repo is not a cube consumer.

**Known deviation, disclosed rather than hidden:** a part retrieves on the
plan's words, which are model-authored — an authority ordinary turns do not
grant (READING-POLICY: retrieval is a function of the question's own words).
The mitigations are mechanical: a part whose words share no term with the
task is a typed `open` entry; part labels are checked with the draft against
the part's own passages; and the task's record only exists when some part
actually retrieved something. An adversarial review (18 agents) confirmed
this deviation can still steer a certified record toward plan-invented
subjects when the corpus happens to contain the plan's words — that residue
is accepted and this paragraph is its disclosure.

## The constitution's channel

`FOLD-CONSTITUTION.md` (repo root, one level up) governs this workbench. It
reaches the model as ONE folded paragraph (`constitution.js::CONSTITUTION_PROMPT`
— the system prompt), and the model is never trusted with any article: the
article→organ map in `constitution.js::ENFORCEMENT` names which code enforces
what, `constitution.test.mjs` is the assay that walks it, and the unwired
articles (III.1 anchor, III.4 opposite, III.5 prediction) are listed there as
unwired — VI.3 — rather than implied as compliant.

## Local only

There is no hosted-model path. The Anthropic SDK, provider select, key input,
and webfonts were all removed 2026-08-16; `constitution.test.mjs` fails on any
non-localhost host in the files the page loads. Do not add one back.

**The scan set is derived, not listed** (2026-08-16, audit finding 4). It was
a hardcoded array of filenames, and it had gone stale by thirteen modules —
render.js, log-pane.js, web.js, quotes.js among them — so the invariant the
policy claimed was not the one the test enforced. `page-graph.mjs` now walks
index.html's script entries and the transitive load graph (imports, dynamic
imports, importScripts, Worker sources, and relative module paths held as
data — term.js's ROSTER is why that last rule exists: the workers are named
in a registry, never in a literal `new Worker("…")`). What is out of scope is
typed and asserted to resolve locally, never silently skipped: `/engine` and
`/nul` (eoreader6's bytes, its own tests), `/node_modules` (vendored, checked
only for being on this disk), the Explore iframe (web.test.mjs's own seam).
Non-local hosts need a TYPED allowance whose reason is itself checked — the
`xmlns` namespace by its attribute context, web.js's archive addresses by the
fact that web.js contains no egress call. Adding a module needs no edit here;
adding a module that reaches a CDN fails the assay.

## The self plane (added 2026-08-16) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

The chat has access to its own cognition on request, held on a plane the
material can never be confused with. P15 in POLICIES.md is the binding
statement; this is the map of the decisions.

**The ledger.** `reflex.js` — per conversation, append-only (seq not clock),
one act per cognitive event: asked / planned / retrieved / checked /
corrected / recorded / folded / surprise / errored / answered-from-state.
Written mechanically from app.js's own turn loop (the same onProgress
branches that already narrate); no model ever authors an entry. Rendered to
a deterministic text (one paragraph per turn), chunked with self-verifying
offsets, addressed as `self:ledger#a-b` — the reserved `self:` namespace,
refused to loaded sources at `addSource`. Self refs re-open in the same
dialog as material refs (rebuilt from entries alone); no Explore deposit —
the ledger is the conversation's, not a file's.

**The levels, on request.** `/self` is the ladder with counts; `/self
acts|surprise|pace|folds|records|sources|passages` are computed tables
(mechanicalTurn — no model call; the new builders live in reflex.js, served
through tables.js). Natural phrasings go through `detectReflex`, which
REQUIRES the second-person tell ("what surprised **you**", "how do **you**
think") and runs after detectTable — a question about surprise IN the
material stays the material's. `/reflect <question>` is the model turn over
the plane: retrieval with the same `retrieve` organ over ledger chunks
(recency slice = RECENCY_WINDOW/2 turn-paragraphs, the fold's own present
converted, plus top-3 term matches), the SELF block distinct from MATERIAL
by framing, the same checks (checkGrounding / attribute / checkCitations /
classifySentences) run against the ledger's bytes, and the warrant typed
`plane: "self"` end to end (fold.js carries it, ON RECORD marks it, the
renderer says it). Material refs quoted inside offered ledger lines join
the known set so they render re-openable, not "invented" — the self plane
may point into the world's record; it never absorbs it.

**Surprise is measured, never asked.** The meter is eoreader6's
`emergence/tiers.js` — `createTierStack(["discourse","atmosphere","lens"])`
+ `foldThrough`, over `surprise.js` — injected via the cast.js pattern so
reflex.js stays node-testable. One arrival per message heard, both roles
(for a computed table, its caption — rows restated from state are not an
arrival). Numbers: window = RECENCY_WINDOW, gamma = the engine's
`gammaFor(window)` = 0.75, draws = 200 and alpha = 1 (read-frankenstein's
declarations), seed = 0 — givers named, nothing tuned here. First arrival =
typed `no_ground` gap. Ranking is mechanical: censored-above first, then
rank, then bits; the caption phrases the null natural-frequency style.
`tiers.js` imports `../../../nul/index.js`, so **both servers carry a
`/nul` mount** beside `/engine` (serve.mjs and explore-server.mjs) — without
it the page dies at import time.

## The graph's three organs and its cursor (added 2026-08-16, second pass)

The Network surface admits belief from three engine organs, each with its own
null, all declared on the result: (1) SVO statements from the clause ladder;
(2) cast co-arrival binding (emergence/binding.js, the read-frankenstein
numbers: window 2, draws 199); (3) **recurring-form co-arrival binding** —
the same organ over the document's own Zipf-filtered vocabulary, arrivals ≥ 2
(binding's structural minimum), form cap 24 and draws 64 as the declared
interactive dial with finestRank carried. (3) exists because concept
documents starve the cast ladder — measured on SEED-SPEAKER.md: cast of four
sentence-initial capitals, one arrival each, graph of 2 nodes; with form
binding, 21 nodes / 38 edges of the document's actual vocabulary structure.
Form nodes are never presented as cast.

The reading cursor: the graph is admitted in ordered stages (12 + one per
binding organ), one snapshot each — scrubbing shows belief AS OF that point;
decay per stage is the organ's own semantics, stated in the UI. Layout is
computed once over the final stage and cached so the cursor scrubs belief,
not geography. Soft breaks in markdown paragraphs join as spaces
(CommonMark); blockquotes keep their lines; pipe tables are explore.js's own
pass (render.js stays table-free per the app.js contract).

## The build log (added 2026-08-16, fourth pass) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

P16 in POLICIES.md is the law; this is the map. The idea, verbatim from the
user: **all builds are append-only logs with EO notation — anything being
built, folded into the projected app, downloadable at any cursor.**

**Files.** `build-log.js` (pure; the engine's `holon/task-log.js` injected —
cast.js pattern — so the page loads it from `/engine` and the tests by
relative path); `build-log.test.mjs` (13 conformance tests against the REAL
engine module); app.js's builds/editor sections consume the fold;
serve.mjs's `POST /api/build-record` writes `record/build-record.jsonl`.

**The shape.** One log per build, one thread: PROPOSE (birth, from the
turn's parsed segment) → SUPERSEDE per committed edit/reset/restore (past
kept) → RESULT per run (attached to the version that ran). `foldBuild(log,
atSeq)` is the projection; the builds panel renders THAT, at the cursor the
reader scrubbed to, and `exportAt` downloads the fold as a file named by its
address (`build-3@5.py`). Restore is a forward SUPERSEDE carrying old bytes,
never a rewind.

**The EO typing is from the act, never the content** (the cube stays refuted
as a content classifier): PROPOSE = SEG·Figure·produced — task-log.js's own
`proposeDiscovered` cell, reused, because artifact.js literally snips the
segment out of the turn's answer; SUPERSEDE = SYN·Figure·produced; RESULT =
no operator (results attach, they never re-type — `produce()`'s own
discipline). SEG→SYN→… never runs the algebra backward; the engine's
`checkCubeProgression` is the pinned referee, not a local restatement.

**The disclosed amendment.** "The cube/operator half of that module is
deliberately NOT carried" (holonic layer, above) is now amended FOR BUILDS
ONLY, by user direction (2026-08-16). holon.js's plan log is untouched and
still carries no operators.

**Edges decided, not implied:** editor keystrokes are a persisted DRAFT
(`entry.draft`), committed to a SUPERSEDE when the draft runs OR when the
editor is left (`commitDraft` in showView/openBuild) — per-keypress entries
would make the log a keylogger, but a draft that never entered the log
would be a second, hidden truth the panel and the download silently
disagree with. The one residue: a reload mid-edit keeps the draft
uncommitted until the editor is next left. Identical code is churn, refused
by `reviseBuild` (the entry would change no state). Result entries keep run
output to a declared budget (16K chars/stream, `kept/of` stated on the
entry) because unbounded results would fail localStorage persistence
silently. localStorage persists `log.entries` alone and restore REPLAYS
them through the engine's `append` (a corrupt row throws and skips that
build, never loads silently); the pre-log mutable shape migrates via
`fromLegacy` to the honest floor — history that was never kept is not
invented. The mirror batches each append-set in ONE request and chains
batches per build, so record rows land in log order; downloads are recorded
as `build-export` crossings. The record mirror lives on serve.mjs only (the
same server that runs builds); a page served from explore-server's 8812
reports the miss to the console, the same posture `/api/run` already has
there.

## The grounding ladder (added 2026-08-16, fifth pass) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

The P12 amendment (hypergraph wired) and the P13 amendment (proof-seeking)
are the law; this is the map. The organizing idea, from the user directly:
grounding is not about never being wrong — it is the visible EFFORT of
reading the output against objective phenomena, where objectivity is the
asymptotic approach toward truth from different perspectives. So support is
never a bit anywhere in this ladder: it is counted perspectives, typed
verdicts, and disclosed limits.

**The ladder, bottom to top.** (1) address tier — `checkCitations` /
`attribute` (unchanged); (1.5) quotation tier — `quotes.js` (P17), NEW:
every quotation followed to the bytes; verbatim quotes self-cite their
chunk mechanically, drifted quotes are REWRITTEN to the source's own bytes
before rendering (repair disclosed, then re-inspected so the record
describes what ships), fabricated quotations join unsupported and drive
correction, outside-offer quotations are typed opens with the anchor where
the words live but never an inline warrant; (2) atom tier —
`checkGrounding` for absence, `corroborateAtoms` (grounding.js) for
STRENGTH: every checkable atom with the passages that state it, refs and
distinct sources counted apart because two chunks of one file are one
perspective; (3) relation tier —
`hypergraph.js`, NEW: the material's own edges (engine organs, injected —
`discoverRelationVocab` / `extractRelations` / the referent index) versus
the answer read with the SAME organs, five typed verdicts (bound /
contradicted / unbound / beyond-reach / unheard — the field's own
convergence: FEVER, SAFE, AIS all keep ≥3 verdicts plus a refusal); (4) the
world — `proof.js` pure + the P13 egress: flagged claims searched on their
own words, pages judged by the same containment fold, verdicts as counted
hosts with the syndication residue named.

**Files.** `hypergraph.js` (+9-case `hypergraph.test.mjs`, against the
REAL engine organs); `proof.js` (+`proof.test.mjs`, offline, with the seam
test extended to app.js/index.html); `cast.js` grew `makeReferentIndex`
(identity face of the resolver — ONE implementation of "the same name",
the resolver is now its boolean projection); `grounding.js` grew
`blankStructure` (shared furniture-blanking, length-preserving) and
`corroborateAtoms`; `provenance.js::classifySentences` takes relation
claims as a fourth argument and rides them on each sentence as `edges`;
holon.js injects the reader per part (`makeRelationReader`), merges
contradicted/unbound into `unsupported` (driving the existing bounded
correction), and returns the report per section; app.js draws badges
(`⇄ contradicted` / `∅ never bound`, click → the passage the material DOES
bind), the tally line's relation counts, and the grounding disclosure
(claim rows with click-through chips, corroboration counts, per-claim
"seek proof online", auto-seek behind the default-off settings toggle).

**Decisions that cost something, kept here.** The closed class for the
relation vocabulary is measured from the POOL via cite.js's `commonTerms`
(CORPUS_MINIMUM floor), NOT material.js's `functionWordSet` at turn scale —
its token-share threshold degenerates on excerpts (measured: "married"
classified as a function word on a three-passage set). `minSurfaces` is 1,
justified structurally (a wider vocabulary can only widen what the reader
HEARS, never fabricate an edge) — never walked against a golden.
Beyond-reach and unheard stay OFF the record's unsupported list: limits of
the instrument must not punish the answer. A verb that only ever appears
negated never enters the vocabulary (the candidate slot holds "never") —
it enters through an affirmative use elsewhere; the extractor is the
engine's declared heuristic and its residues (subordinate "that" clauses
consuming an edge, a colon overrunning the polarity window) are engine
territory, not silently patched here. Proof-seeking is sequential, never a
fan-out burst; the per-claim click is its own authorization and the toggle
is the standing one; nothing anywhere phrases a web verdict stronger than
"stated by N of M pages (K distinct hosts)".

## Skills (added 2026-08-16, third pass) — procedures kept as code

P14 in POLICIES.md is the law; this is the map. The ask this answers: when
the fold has worked out how to make a kind of output once, the *how* must not
stay locked in prose or in a model's habits — it becomes an executable
program the instrument calls, and the model's remaining job is slot-filling.
Skills are NOT instruction sets for the model; the model never sees or runs
a body. They are code, and they stack.

**Files.** `skills.js` (pure, browser-safe: shape, digest identity, the
append-only library log, mechanical claiming on declared anchors,
mechanical-first slot filling with one grammar-constrained fallback call,
`runSkilledTask` dispatch, authoring prompts + `SKILL_SCHEMA` +
`parseSkillCandidate`); `skill-runner.mjs` (Node: empty-context vm execution
with organs granted by declaration, `admitSkill` — the gate, `skills.call`
stacking with a depth budget, content-addressed persistence in
`skills/<digest>.json` plus append-only `record/skill-record.jsonl`);
`skills.test.mjs` (22 conformance tests — the walls themselves, not stubs).

**The ladder.** skill (zero model calls) → slot-fill (one constrained call,
validated) → model path (holon.js, unchanged — holon.js was deliberately not
touched; `runSkilledTask` takes the model path as an injected `runModel`).
Every descent is a typed `open` entry. Dispatch is mechanical (P4's spirit):
all of a skill's anchors must appear in the task's own words through the
shared fold; most anchors wins; a tie is refused as ambiguous, never guessed.

**The gate.** A candidate (model-authored or hand-written — same gate) is
admitted only if its shape is whole, its body and check pass the
forbidden-token scan, both compile, and ITS OWN CHECK passes against its own
body in the real sandbox with the real library — so admission order is
dependency order, and what passed admission is what will run. A skill
without a check is refused as a wish. Refusals stay on the log.

**Honest edges, disclosed here rather than papered over:** the vm sandbox is
an authority wall by construction (empty context + declared grants + token
scan), not a hardened security boundary — P1 local-only is the outer wall;
the run budget guards await points, and a synchronous spin inside a body is
the one hole it does not cover (the compile step alone runs under a vm
timeout); free string slots are never filled mechanically because there is
no unambiguous mechanical reading of "which words are the value."

## The build log — code as a projection of an append-only record (added 2026-08-16, third pass)

Code never appears in the chat as a block. It is deposited as an ADDENDUM to a
build's append-only log, and the code file in `materials/` is PROJECTED from
that log — the way a working tree is checked out from git history. The log is
the record; the file is a view of it.

**Files.** `builds.js` (pure: the vocabulary of addenda, the hash, the
projection, the diff, the anchor that routes new code onto an existing build);
`builds.test.mjs` (13 conformance tests — sealed chained hashes, projection
from head alone, reset re-projects deposit, the anchor reads only the number);
`serve.mjs` (`POST /api/builds/log` and `GET /api/builds/<slug>` — the server
owns the record: it stamps the time, writes `record/builds/<slug>.jsonl`,
projects the content-addressed file into `materials/`, and best-effort tells
Explore about the deposit so it surfaces in "My files" on the first deposit
only; `app.js` — the chat emits prose plus a compact `▤ build N · file.py · N
addenda` handle; the Builds pane shows the git-style log and the "file" button
opens the projection in Explore).

**The addendum vocabulary.** deposit (the model first produced this code;
the seed), revision (the model produced new code for an existing build —
routed by `referencedBuild`'s mechanical anchor "build 3"), edit (the operator
saved in the build editor), reset (the projection returns to the deposit),
run (the projection was executed; the outcome is the addendum). Each verb
is declared; the vocabulary is closed.

**The hash.** Every addendum is sealed by `seq`, `prev`, and a SHA-256 `hash`
over its canonical payload (kind, message, code, lang, author, run, prev). The
hash is chained — a re-append from the serialized record lines alone
reproduces the same log, byte-for-byte, the resumption property the skill
log already proved.

**The projection.** `projectCode(log)` returns the code of the last
code-bearing addendum. A `revision`, `edit`, or `reset` moves the
projection; a `run` does not. The file lands at
`materials/<slug>.<hash8>.<ext>`, content-addressed: every revision is a new
file and every old one stays on disk like a git object. On deposit only,
best-effort `POST` to the Explore server adds a library ref so the file
surfaces in "My files" without anyone browsing for it. Revisions re-project
but do not re-list — the build's log keeps the history, the file keeps
the head.

**The chat.** Prose only. Code is a one-line handle to the build; clicking
it scrolls the Builds pane. The "open file" control in the pane opens the
projection in Explore.

**Known design choice, not a gap:** `nameFor` takes a filename token with a
known extension if the model wrote one (the natural thing: "save it as
countdown.py" lands on `countdown.py`); without one, the first prose line
slugified, then the server disambiguates a taken name mechanically. A build
named `build-4.py` is honest — the model did not name it.

## The terminal (added 2026-08-16, sixth pass) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

P18 in POLICIES.md is the law; this is the map. The user's direction: the
terminal only runs in the browser sandbox — and still gets to be a real
instrument (python, sql, js, and the fold itself as runtimes).

**Files.** `term.js` — the registry (ROSTER + REFUSED, both typed), the
drawer's command wiring, the fold runtime, the continuation grammar
(`continues` + `isControl`), the CSV walk (`csvTable`), the named budgets;
pure parts exported and tested. `term-js-worker.mjs` — module worker, REPL
over indirect eval (var/function persist, let/const do not — said in its
ready note, not fixed with a rewriter). `term-py-worker.mjs` — module
worker; pyodide imported dynamically INSIDE boot so node can import the
file's severed list without resolving /node_modules URLs. `term-sql-worker.js`
— a CLASSIC worker on purpose: sql.js is UMD and importScripts is the one
loader that hands it a global scope; importScripts is then severed with the
rest right after boot. `term.test.mjs` — P18's assay. app.js's whole
terminal section is now one `initTerminal(bridge)` call handing over
accessors (the cast.js pattern); log-pane.js still owns how the drawer is
SHOWN; serve.mjs lost the exec routes and tools/ entirely.

**Decisions that cost something, kept here:**

- **Vendored, never CDN.** pyodide (13MB) and sql.js land in node_modules
  like monaco already did; `.wasm`/`.zip` got MIME entries in BOTH servers
  (each serves the chat page whole). II.13's scan list now includes the
  terminal's four files. No PyPI at runtime follows from no-CDN: micropip
  and loadPackage would need egress and are absent, not shimmed — pip is a
  typed refusal naming P1.
- **The severed list is one list held in three files**, agreement pinned by
  test — a worker file stays standalone, and drift is a failing test, not a
  quiet hole. Severing is defineProperty-on-the-worker-global:
  construction, not hardening, P14's own disclosed posture.
- **`exit` is a control word checked before the continuation grammar.**
  Measured live: sql's own semicolon rule swallowed `exit` and the prompt
  wedged at "…". The grammar alone still swallows it — the ORDER is the
  fix, and the test says so.
- **Material crosses visibly.** A runtime gets a snapshot of every loaded
  source at boot, `mount` re-syncs on demand, and the crossing is printed
  where it happens ("material crossing into the sandbox: N sources, M
  bytes"). The mute stays a retrieval concept — muted sources cross too.
- **One command at a time, no stdin, no queue.** A submit during flight is
  dropped with a line (the old pane's own posture); there is no stdin
  because there is no PTY — the runtimes are the REPLs. Interrupt (✕ or
  ctrl+c) is worker termination; the state loss is said in the same line.
- **WebContainers / WebVM / ssh / node stay refused with reasons** in the
  `runtimes` command — licence + CDN, external proxy, egress, the machine —
  so the next pass does not re-derive why the famous routes are absent. The
  registry itself takes any runtime a localhost-served module can boot
  (ruby.wasm, php-wasm, WebR are one vendored package + one ROSTER row
  away).

**Known edges, disclosed:** the browser tools' synthetic key events did not
reach the input during verification (real typing does; the live run drove
the same handler with dispatched KeyboardEvents); a worker that spins
synchronously is stoppable only by ✕ (the same one hole the skills sandbox
discloses for its run budget); terminal acts are not on the record — the
old terminal's posture, kept deliberately; a term-record mirror is named
future work, not implied.

## The measuring door (added 2026-08-17, seventh pass) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

P19 in POLICIES.md is the law; this is the map. The ask this answers, from the
user directly: the fold should carry **standardized eoreader6-based statistics
modules, so DFR-repo-style analysis stops being hand-rolled** — and the point
is to make *people*, not only the model, less prone to bullshitting.

**Nothing was added to eoreader6, and that is the finding.** The organs were
already there and the search-before-you-write rule found them: `nul/index.js`
(1,306 lines — PERTURBATIONS × STATISTICS with a `LICENSED` table, ~20 typed
gap types, `ground` / `difference` / `extremeGround`, the censoring floor) and
`emergence/binding.js` (displacement / reversal / reseed nulls, transfer
entropy, per-pair `bindLinks`). What was missing was never a statistic. It was
the **gate**, and `nul` says in as many words that the gate is the caller's to
ask for: "NOT enforced inside `ground` … An organ that wants the guarantee asks
for it." So the gate is the fold's, the statistics stay the engine's, and the
standing rule (*leave everything you can in eoreader6*) is honoured by
subtraction rather than by a port.

**Files.** `measure.js` — pure, organs injected (cast.js pattern): the
declaration grammar, `admit` (the gate), the table→series and table→arrivals
adapters, `measureSeries` / `measureAcross` / `measurePairs`, the single
`runMeasurement` router, `phrase` and `toTable`. `measure.test.mjs` — 35
conformance tests against the REAL nul and binding modules.
`eval/measure-real-data.mjs` + `eval/fixtures/santa-ana-flight-hours.csv` —
the door run on 1,021 real drone flights. app.js's `measureTurn` is plumbing
only: find the named file, hand the declaration to the router, print whichever
of result-or-refusal came back. No server change: both mounts (`/engine`,
`/nul`) already existed, and `page-graph.mjs` picked `measure.js` up on its own
— "adding a module needs no edit here" held.

**The grammar is keyed, not positional** (`series:` / `across:` / `pairs:` /
`at:` / `as:` / `trying:` / `broken:` / `draws:` / `window:` / `seed:` /
`direction:`), order-free, because a reader is declaring a spec and a
positional form would make the fourth number they type silently mean something
else. `broken:` is the plain-language name for a perturbation (the handbook's
own "break it on purpose"); nul's registry keys stay underneath so there is no
second vocabulary to drift.

**Decisions that cost something, kept here:**

- **The fixture is copied, not read across repos.** Twenty-four integers from
  `dfr-causal-analysis/profiles/profile-santa-ana.json`. Reaching over there
  would have inherited the exact defect that repo's own paper lists under
  limitations ("cannot be reproduced by a third party") while criticising it.
- **The real-data declarations were fixed before the run and never revisited**
  (eoreader6's tune-nothing-against-the-answer rule, applied to a measurement's
  parameters). window 8 = a patrol shift, a unit of the world the material came
  from; draws 200 = this repo's standing null-arm number, giver named.
- **The result is worth knowing.** The declared question returns *censored
  above* (59.25 flights in the largest 8-hour mean, above all 200 shuffles).
  The same observation against a spectrum-preserving null sits at 59/200 —
  unremarkable. Two nulls, opposite readings, and only one pairing established:
  that contrast is the licensing gate's whole justification, found live rather
  than argued.
- **Two walls were found by RUNNING it, not by reasoning about it** (P5.5's
  discipline, both directions). (1) The `best_of_n` refusal was correct and
  **unreachable** — the only route into `measureAcross` was supplying the very
  `direction:` whose absence it refuses, so a sound wall nobody could touch.
  `across:` exists because of that; a refusal no declaration can trigger is a
  comment, not a wall, and its test now goes through the grammar. (2) `nul`'s
  `window >= 2` had been carried across to co-arrival, where `displacementNull`
  states its own floor of 1 — so a legitimate "arrived at an adjacent position"
  was refused. Each floor is now the consuming organ's own.
- **One router, because there were briefly two.** app.js's turn and the eval
  each grew a three-way dispatch and disagreed within the hour (one routed on
  `direction`, the other on `across`). `runMeasurement` is the only
  implementation, and it re-runs the gate so no path reaches a measurement that
  skipped it — eoreader6's "reconcile, don't dedupe" rule, applied before the
  second copy could rot.
- **`measured` is a new act on the reflex ledger and reflex.js was NOT edited.**
  Its `stableDetail` fallback renders an unknown act deterministically from
  sorted keys — the module's own designed extension point.

**Known edges, disclosed:** the causal door is deliberately absent. `binding.js`
carries `transferEntropy` and `reversalNull`, and the DFR work measured both an
inflated false-positive rate and 100/100 false positives on common-cause
synthetic data — the paper's own conclusion is that confounding "requires
design, not statistics." A `/measure … causes:` door would therefore need a
design declaration, not another null, and that is scoped work rather than
something to bolt on here. Also absent: a space-time (position-held,
time-permuted) perturbation, which is the one null `matter_grouping.py`
hand-rolled that has no organ yet — `measurePairs` covers the co-arrival
question over ordered positions, not the spatial one. And the DFR scripts
themselves are untouched: this door is what they should have called, but
porting them is its own pass.
