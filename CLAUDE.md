# The Fold — inherited law

This repo does not get to invent its own rules. The canon lives elsewhere and
is read first:

| document | what it governs | path |
|---|---|---|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | what an organ may do, what is legacy, what an amendment costs | `../eo-constitution/` |
| `LAWS.md` | eoWebLLM's laws, L1–L7 — each one a mistake made twice | `../eoWebLLM/LAWS.md` |
| `READING-POLICY.md` | **canonical for how reading works** — P0–P6 | `../eoreader6/` |
| `CUBE.md`, `12-nine-terrains…md` | the nine terrains as a *representation* standard | `../eoreader6/` |
| `SEED.md` | perceive only by difference from a ground you rebuild | `../eoreader6/` |

The rest of this file is the mapping: which law binds which file here, where
this repo already complies, and where it knowingly does not. It exists so the
next pass does not re-derive any of it from scratch — which is what happened
through most of this one, at real cost.

## Laws this repo is built on

**L5 — a compliance-critical fact is never left to the model's own
instruction-following.** The load-bearing one. `BASE_PROMPT` asks for an
address after every claim; two models four times apart in size ignored it on
tabular material, zero addresses across six turns. The fix was not a better
prompt: `cite.js` attaches the address mechanically, `grounding.js` checks
every figure and name against the bytes, `tables.js` computes a table the app
already knows the answer to rather than asking for one. **This law was
rediscovered here by measurement before it was read. It was already written
down.**

**READING-POLICY P1 — activation decays, identity does not, recall is
retrieval.** `RECENCY_WINDOW` is the reach of the present, not the size of
memory. A turn that falls out of it is not forgotten; its record is addressed
and re-openable. *Never enlarge the window to fix a recall failure* — if
something is not coming back, the defect is in retrieval or coreference.

**P5.2 — normalize before computing offsets; byte-offset self-verification is
mandatory.** Every chunker here is verified: 121/121 row groups on the MNPD
CSV, 670/670 on the Nashville slice, 11,132/11,132 on War and Peace.

**P5.3 — strip container boilerplate.** Was violated until just now: 47 of
11,190 War and Peace passages were the Gutenberg licence and donation appeal,
fully retrievable and citable. `stripContainer` in `source.js` drops them and
carries the offset forward so addresses still name the file on disk.

**P4 — numbers are declared, gaps are results.** Partially honoured. `retrieve`
has no relevance floor by design; `checkGrounding` distinguishes `examined`
from `clean`; `openQuestions` reports a gap rather than guessing. But
`ROWS_PER_CHUNK`, `NULL_SAMPLES`, `CORPUS_MINIMUM` and `MAX_FINDINGS` are
hand-picked constants that P4 says should be derived from the material. **Open
debt.**

**P5.5 — when a result surprises you, check the driver before the theory.**
Honoured twice: the attribution false-warrant rate was traced to the null, not
to the corpus; the "fix didn't work" was traced to a stale module served from
cache, not to the fix.

**L2 — capitalisation is a differentiator, never the primary signal.**
`cite.js::namesIn` uses capitalisation to find names and then *vetoes* on them;
it never admits an entity on capitalisation alone. `grounding.js` carries the
discourse-adverb stoplist for the same reason.

## What this repo may not do

**The cube is not a content classifier.** `packages/engine/operators.js` records
the measurement: 95.7% of cell assignments survived shuffling the words inside
2,527 paragraphs. Deriving a terrain from a passage is a refuted move. The nine
terrains are a representation standard and a dispatch key for verbs — never a
label computed from text.

**Only two of the nine terrains have lenses today** (Entity, Link — referent
identity and modifier scope; `eoreader6/reading/index.js` says so in its own
header). "All the terrains" is not available anywhere, including in eoreader6.
A reading with no lens on a terrain omits it, and that omission must stay
visible — never silently implied as "there is nothing there."

**Nothing is ported from `eoreader4.x`.** Constitution I.2: legacy is frozen
reference; a legacy organ that has not been re-earned does not exist for
placement purposes.

## Where the engine already does it

Do not rebuild these. `eoreader6/packages/host/` is the assembled reader:

- `createSession` / `admitChunked` / `ingestFile` — admission, chunked, with
  byte-accurate spans and provenance. Ingests 3.3MB in 8.4s.
- `searchSpans` — retrieval returning `{span_id, source_id, byte_start,
  byte_end, text}`, the same address shape this repo's refs use.
- `sessionReferents` / `sessionRelations` — coreference and relations.
- `executePrompt` (`surfer.js`) — the address ladder SOURCE → HEADING →
  CONTENT → WINDOW, "never fabrication".
- `emergence/surprise.js` — novelty (Shannon surprisal) and Bayesian surprise,
  kept apart, provably identical only at full commitment. This is the measured
  answer to "what is most interesting", and the only licensed one.

One measured gap found while wiring: `searchSpans` does not fold diacritics —
`Natásha` returns three spans, `Natasha` returns zero. This repo's `tokenize`
does fold them. Same bug class, opposite state.
