# The Fold — inherited law

This repo does not get to invent its own rules. The canon lives elsewhere and
is read first. This repo's own operating policies — the standing decisions
made under that canon, each with its evidence and its enforcing test — are in
`POLICIES.md` and bind every session working here.

| document | what it governs | path |
|---|---|---|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | what an organ may do, what is legacy, what an amendment costs | `../eo-constitution/` |
| `LAWS.md` | eoWebLLM's laws, L1–L7 — each one a mistake made twice | `../eoWebLLM/LAWS.md` |
| `READING-POLICY.md` | **canonical for how reading works** — P0–P6 | `../eoreader6/` |
| `CUBE.md`, `12-nine-terrains…md` | the nine terrains as a *representation* standard | `../eoreader6/` |
| `SEED.md` | perceive only by difference from a ground you rebuild | `../eoreader6/` |

The rest of this file is the mapping: which law binds which file here, where
this repo already complies, and where it knowingly does not. It exists so the
next pass does not re-derive any of it from scratch — which is what happened
through most of this one, at real cost.

## Laws this repo is built on

**L5 — a compliance-critical fact is never left to the model's own
instruction-following.** The load-bearing one. `BASE_PROMPT` asks for an
address after every claim; two models four times apart in size ignored it on
tabular material, zero addresses across six turns. The fix was not a better
prompt: `cite.js` attaches the address mechanically, `grounding.js` checks
every figure and name against the bytes, `tables.js` computes a table the app
already knows the answer to rather than asking for one. **This law was
rediscovered here by measurement before it was read. It was already written
down.**

**READING-POLICY P1 — activation decays, identity does not, recall is
retrieval.** `RECENCY_WINDOW` is the reach of the present, not the size of
memory. A turn that falls out of it is not forgotten; its record is addressed
and re-openable. *Never enlarge the window to fix a recall failure* — if
something is not coming back, the defect is in retrieval or coreference.

**P5.2 — normalize before computing offsets; byte-offset self-verification is
mandatory.** Every chunker here is verified: 121/121 row groups on the MNPD
CSV, 670/670 on the Nashville slice, 11,132/11,132 on War and Peace.

**P5.3 — strip container boilerplate.** Was violated until just now: 47 of
11,190 War and Peace passages were the Gutenberg licence and donation appeal,
fully retrievable and citable. `stripContainer` in `source.js` drops them and
carries the offset forward so addresses still name the file on disk.

**P4 — numbers are declared, gaps are results.** Partially honoured. `retrieve`
has no relevance floor by design; `checkGrounding` distinguishes `examined`
from `clean`; `openQuestions` reports a gap rather than guessing. But
`ROWS_PER_CHUNK`, `NULL_SAMPLES`, `CORPUS_MINIMUM` and `MAX_FINDINGS` are
hand-picked constants that P4 says should be derived from the material. **Open
debt.**

**P5.5 — when a result surprises you, check the driver before the theory.**
Honoured twice: the attribution false-warrant rate was traced to the null, not
to the corpus; the "fix didn't work" was traced to a stale module served from
cache, not to the fix.

**L2 — capitalisation is a differentiator, never the primary signal.**
`cite.js::namesIn` uses capitalisation to find names and then *vetoes* on them;
it never admits an entity on capitalisation alone. `grounding.js` carries the
discourse-adverb stoplist for the same reason.

---

## What this repo may not do

**The cube is not a content classifier.** `packages/engine/operators.js` records
the measurement: 95.7% of cell assignments survived shuffling the words inside
2,527 paragraphs. Deriving a terrain from a passage is a refuted move. The nine
terrains are a representation standard and a dispatch key for verbs — never a
label computed from text.

**Only two of the nine terrains have lenses today** (Entity, Link — referent
identity and modifier scope; `eoreader6/reading/index.js` says so in its own
header). "All the terrains" is not available anywhere, including in eoreader6.
A reading with no lens on a terrain omits it, and that omission must stay
visible — never silently implied as "there is nothing there."

**Nothing is ported from `eoreader4.x`.** Constitution I.2: legacy is frozen
reference; a legacy organ that has not been re-earned does not exist for
placement purposes.

---

## Where the engine already does it

Do not rebuild these. `eoreader6/packages/host/` is the assembled reader:

- `createSession` / `admitChunked` / `ingestFile` — admission, chunked, with
  byte-accurate spans and provenance. Ingests 3.3MB in 8.4s.
- `searchSpans` — retrieval returning `{span_id, source_id, byte_start,
  byte_end, text}`, the same address shape this repo's refs use.
- `sessionReferents` / `sessionRelations` — coreference and relations.
- `executePrompt` (`surfer.js`) — the address ladder SOURCE → HEADING →
  CONTENT → WINDOW, "never fabrication".
- `emergence/surprise.js` — novelty (Shannon surprisal) and Bayesian surprise,
  kept apart, provably identical only at full commitment. This is the measured
  answer to "what is most interesting", and the only licensed one.

One measured gap found while wiring — `searchSpans` did not fold diacritics
(`Natásha` returned three spans, `Natasha` zero, while this repo's `tokenize`
folds; same bug class, opposite state) — was CLOSED upstream 2026-08-16:
eoreader6's READING-POLICY A23 records it, `searchSpans` now folds both
sides through the session's one `diaNorm`, and the cross-organ agreement
fixture its P7.1 demanded exists (`conformance/fold-agreement.test.js`).
Admission also now strips the container at the door (A20's container half),
so `wp:chunk-0` is no longer the PG header — spans are body-only, with byte
addresses still naming the received file.

## Explore (added 2026-08-16) — what was decided, so it is not re-derived

Explore is the data explorer: one source in focus, its surfaces revealed as
plain-named views (source / cast / relations / graph / trace / kinds / gaps /
projections / legend). **The nine-terrain grid never fronts the UI** — the
user refused the 3×3 map ("surfaces should reveal themselves"); the canon
lives in the legend view, typed `received` with its giver.

**Files.** `explore-server.mjs` (port 8812; localhost-only CORS; serves this
whole directory INCLUDING the `/engine` mount serve.mjs has — without that
mount the chat page half-loads and its tab handler silently never binds),
`explore-worker.mjs`, `explore.html`, `explore/explore.{css,js}`,
`explore-bridge.js`, `render.js` (+ tests). Engine work lives in
**eoreader6 `packages/host/terrains.js`** (sessionTerrains / sessionKinds /
kindsNullArm, conformance in `host-terrains.test.js`) — the user's standing
rule is *leave everything you can in eoreader6*.

**The record (FOLD-CONSTITUTION I.5).** `record/explore-record.jsonl`,
append-only: every source open, every job with its declared parameters,
every deposit, every error. Never truncated, never rewritten. Deposits from
Converse land content-addressed in `materials/`.

**Coordinate spaces, never mixed silently.** `b0/b1` = UTF-8 bytes (engine);
`c0/c1` = JS-string chars (chat refs; `readRange` slices the JS string).
`explore.js::byteCharIndex` converts; deep links carry whichever space they
were born in.

**Kinds ship armed.** induceKinds fabricates on structureless material
(eo-evidence: 10% against a registered 5% bar), so every run carries a
per-population null arm (redealt copies, marginals preserved, co-occurrence
destroyed), DEFERRED so the kinds render first as `provisional` and the arm
lands after. Draws are caller-declared; **the renderer may never phrase
finer than the arm's `finestRank`** — the banner sentence is built from
draws/drawsWithKinds, natural-frequency style. Tiny populations return a
typed `refused-as-underpowered` gap, never the engine's raw throw.

**Atmosphere runs at hop = window.** Not an optimisation: the slack-run
null is calibrated at that stride (loops/reading-regime.js: 55–90% false
alarms at stride 1 vs 0–3% at window). hop=1 was the miscalibrated choice —
and also 148s of what used to be a 7-minute read of War and Peace.

**Reads stream.** `sessionTerrains` emits each surface as its organ
finishes, cheapest first (Field ms → Atmosphere ~30s → cast ~88s → graph
~25s on the 3.3MB Tolstoy; admission itself is 8.6s). The worker forwards
each as `reading:<Surface>`; the server accumulates `job.partial`; the page
reveals views progressively. Completed reads are memoized in-memory by
path·mtime·size and reuse is recorded (`read-reused`), never silent.

**Embed contract.** The chat page hosts Explore as a pane
(`pane-explore` → iframe `http://localhost:8812/explore.html?embed=1`,
loading=lazy). Embed mode drops Explore's own chrome; the rail folds behind
☰. Explore → chat crossings are postMessages:
`{type: "fold:material:add", name, path, text}` — the chat side owns the
listener, its sources strip, and mute/unmute. The Material TAB is removed
by user direction (drop-anywhere and paste flows remain).

**Shared-file ownership (multi-session).** `app.js` interior, holon.js,
constitution.js belong to the fold-architecture session — render.js was
built to its contract (block structure only; every inline run through
`decorateInline`; fenced code and tables belong to artifact.js; addresses
`[name#a-b]` are opaque tokens). `.tabs` in index.html is the panel tab
bar; anything header-level must not take that class. Hard rule enforced by
constitution.test.mjs: **no non-localhost host anywhere** — no webfonts, no
CDN, nothing.

The same class then surfaced INSIDE this repo, found by running the
instrument on War and Peace (2026-08-16): `tokenize` folded, so retrieval
found the right chapters, while `grounding.js`'s containment index and
`cite.js`'s name veto did not fold — so Bezúkhov and Hélène, plainly in the
retrieved bytes, were flagged "not in the material" and real attributions
risked the veto. Fixed with one shared `foldDiacritics` (source.js) applied
on BOTH sides of every containment; regression pinned in
`grounding.test.mjs`. The lesson generalizes: every organ that compares text
to text must share retrieval's fold, or a found passage fails the very check
that should confirm it.

---

## The holonic layer, and its one known deviation

`holon.js` runs a task as parts: plan (shape enforced by decoding grammar,
never by instruction), then per part the same organs an ordinary turn uses.
The plan is an append-only log in `task-log.js`'s vocabulary (propose /
supersede / evidence / result / retract; seq not clock; supersession keeps
the past; evidence accumulates from any entry; payload carried through the
fold) — the cube/operator half of that module is deliberately NOT carried:
this repo is not a cube consumer.

**Known deviation, disclosed rather than hidden:** a part retrieves on the
plan's words, which are model-authored — an authority ordinary turns do not
grant (READING-POLICY: retrieval is a function of the question's own words).
The mitigations are mechanical: a part whose words share no term with the
task is a typed `open` entry; part labels are checked with the draft against
the part's own passages; and the task's record only exists when some part
actually retrieved something. An adversarial review (18 agents) confirmed
this deviation can still steer a certified record toward plan-invented
subjects when the corpus happens to contain the plan's words — that residue
is accepted and this paragraph is its disclosure.

## The constitution's channel

`FOLD-CONSTITUTION.md` (repo root, one level up) governs this workbench. It
reaches the model as ONE folded paragraph (`constitution.js::CONSTITUTION_PROMPT`
— the system prompt), and the model is never trusted with any article: the
article→organ map in `constitution.js::ENFORCEMENT` names which code enforces
what, `constitution.test.mjs` is the assay that walks it, and the unwired
articles (III.1 anchor, III.4 opposite, III.5 prediction) are listed there as
unwired — VI.3 — rather than implied as compliant.

## Local only

There is no hosted-model path. The Anthropic SDK, provider select, key input,
and webfonts were all removed 2026-08-16; `constitution.test.mjs` fails on any
non-localhost host in the files the page loads. Do not add one back.

## The graph's three organs and its cursor (added 2026-08-16, second pass)

The Network surface admits belief from three engine organs, each with its own
null, all declared on the result: (1) SVO statements from the clause ladder;
(2) cast co-arrival binding (emergence/binding.js, the read-frankenstein
numbers: window 2, draws 199); (3) **recurring-form co-arrival binding** —
the same organ over the document's own Zipf-filtered vocabulary, arrivals ≥ 2
(binding's structural minimum), form cap 24 and draws 64 as the declared
interactive dial with finestRank carried. (3) exists because concept
documents starve the cast ladder — measured on SEED-SPEAKER.md: cast of four
sentence-initial capitals, one arrival each, graph of 2 nodes; with form
binding, 21 nodes / 38 edges of the document's actual vocabulary structure.
Form nodes are never presented as cast.

The reading cursor: the graph is admitted in ordered stages (12 + one per
binding organ), one snapshot each — scrubbing shows belief AS OF that point;
decay per stage is the organ's own semantics, stated in the UI. Layout is
computed once over the final stage and cached so the cursor scrubs belief,
not geography. Soft breaks in markdown paragraphs join as spaces
(CommonMark); blockquotes keep their lines; pipe tables are explore.js's own
pass (render.js stays table-free per the app.js contract).
