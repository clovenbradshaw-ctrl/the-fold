# The Fold — operating policies

What may be done here and how, one level below the constitution. The
constitution (`../FOLD-CONSTITUTION.md`) says what may be *asserted*; these
policies say how this repo *works*. Each names its evidence and its
enforcement point, per VI.1: a policy whose violation no test can catch is a
wish, and is marked as such. Amendments append; they do not rewrite.

## P1 — Local only

No request leaves the machine: the model is Ollama on localhost, the fonts
are the system's, there is no API-key path and none may be added.
**Evidence:** the hosted path was removed 2026-08-16 at the user's direction;
the corpora this instrument is for (surveillance records among them) make
this the only acceptable arrangement.
**Enforced:** `constitution.test.mjs` fails on any non-localhost host in any
file the page loads.

## P2 — The model is the mouth, and protocols are physics

The model is never expected to follow a protocol — no tool calls, no exact
JSON shapes, no citation formats relied on. Structure is obtained by
grammar (a JSON schema passed as Ollama's `format`, enforced by the
decoder) or extracted mechanically from whatever text arrives
(balanced-bracket walks, object unwrapping). A parse failure is fixed by
widening the extractor or degrading to a typed gap — never by asking the
model harder.
**Evidence:** under plain `format: "json"` gemma2:2b physically cannot emit
the plan array (one object is where that grammar ends); under the schema it
emits three clean parts. Two models 4× apart in size ignored the cite
instruction identically.
**Enforced:** `parsePlan` tests cover talk-wrapped, object-wrapped,
part-shaped, and unparseable replies; `normalizeSummary` survives a hostile
refresh; nothing downstream reads model output without a mechanical check.

## P3 — A plan is inserts on an append-only log

Plans are never mutated. Entries are appended (propose / supersede /
evidence / result / retract, ordered by `seq`, no clock); the current plan
is a fold over the log; supersession keeps the past because "the work was
once seen that way" is itself evidence. Evidence accumulates from any entry
carrying it; unrecognized keys are payload and ride through the fold; a
missing field is a typed gap with a reason.
**Evidence:** the `task-log.js` lineage — identical code drove six domains
in eochat (67 tests), was re-earned in the engine (42/42 conformance), and
rebuilds byte-identically from `log.entries` alone at all 7 interruption
points of the resumption eval.
**Enforced:** `holon.test.mjs` — append-only invariants, supersession,
evidence accumulation, and a resumption test (fold rebuilt from serialized
entries alone).

## P4 — Decompose only on a counted property

A task is split only when the request's own shape says so: several
substantive clauses, each pinning its own concrete anchor
(`needsDecomposition`), or the explicit `/task` door. Never a model call
deciding, never "a corpus happens to be loaded."
**Evidence:** eochat's own eval — default holonic decomposition LOST to the
flat fold, 5/9 vs 7/9. The model-JSON `decomposes` boolean came back
malformed exactly on the turns that needed it (eochatX, commit c7f55ba).
**Enforced:** gate tests in `holon.test.mjs`; the door order test — the
explicit door is checked before every heuristic.

## P5 — Production closes on the fold, and halt facts stay distinct

Execution is the closure: run what is live and unrun, fire mechanical rules
on the fold's own evidence, append what they yield, refold; stop at
fixpoint (fold digest unchanged) or the step guard. Fixpoint, guard-trip,
and open-gaps-remaining are three different facts; only closure with no
gaps means done, and a tripped guard is a typed `open` entry on the record.
**Evidence:** `produce()` in the eochat spine, including its measured
regression (closure by entry count churned forever; fold digest fixed it).
**Enforced:** the production-retry test (stray part superseded, live fold
holds only the grounded retry) and the halt-fact assertions.

## P6 — A record exists only where a check ran

ON RECORD authority requires that some part actually retrieved material and
had its checks run. Caps on a record's lists compress overflow into a
visible count ("+N more — see the run log"), never a silent drop.
**Evidence:** the adversarial review (18 agents) reproduced unchecked prose
acquiring record authority through the original holonic path; the guard
send() already held was extended to tasks.
**Enforced:** the record guard in `holonicTurn`; capped-list construction
against `RECORD_*_MAX` from fold.js.

## P7 — The one disclosed deviation: plan-steered retrieval

A holonic part retrieves on the plan's words, which are model-authored — an
authority ordinary turns do not grant. This is accepted, bounded, and
visible: a part sharing no term with the task is a typed `open` entry; part
labels are checked with drafts against the part's own passages; the retry
rule repairs the strayed-and-empty case in the task's own words. The
residue (a plan steering toward subjects the corpus happens to contain)
stays disclosed in CLAUDE.md rather than papered over.
**Enforced:** stray-disclosure and label-check tests; the disclosure
paragraph itself is the policy.

## P8 — The constitution's channel is one fold plus a map

The model receives exactly one bounded paragraph
(`constitution.js::CONSTITUTION_PROMPT`) — the articles a mouth can honor.
Every enforceable article binds code, named in the `ENFORCEMENT` map;
articles nothing wires (III.1, III.4, III.5) are listed as unwired, per
VI.3, and the assay fails if the unwired list is ever emptied by fiat.
**Enforced:** `constitution.test.mjs` walks the map and probes each row's
behavior with the real organs.

## P9 — Numbers are earned, budgets are named

No tuned detection constants. A bounded pass (MAX_CORRECTIONS,
MAX_PRODUCE_STEPS, maxParts) is a budget with a name and a stated duty —
runaway backstop, not quality threshold — and the last state stands with
its failures on the record when a budget runs out. Constants that P4 of the
reading policy says should be derived (ROWS_PER_CHUNK, NULL_SAMPLES,
CORPUS_MINIMUM, MAX_FINDINGS) remain documented as open debt in CLAUDE.md.
**Enforced:** the correction-budget test (a stubborn model's failure stays
on record); the debt list is the honest remainder.

## P10 — A policy change lands with its test

Per VI.1: an amendment that cannot be expressed as a changed failing test
is an exception, not an amendment. Every policy above cites its test; a new
policy without one is marked as a wish until its test exists.

## P11 — A name is a reference to a referent, never a byte sequence

Every organ that compares text to text shares the pipeline's one fold, and
every check on a NAME consults the referent the material itself establishes
— via the engine's own cast organs (`extractSurfaces` / `discoverReferents`
/ `namesCorefer`, injected through `cast.js`), never a local
reimplementation of what "the same name" means. Two consequences:

- **The fold is one, and shared.** Retrieval folding what a check does not
  fold makes a found passage fail the check that should confirm it.
  Measured live: `tokenize` folded diacritics, the grounding index didn't,
  and Bezúkhov — plainly in the retrieved bytes — was flagged invented.
  A string fold is only ever the orthographic slice of referent identity;
  it is licensed by the referent, not by convenience.
- **Support is asymmetric where coreference is not.** A sub-form of an
  established name ("Bezukhov" where the material writes "Pierre Bezúkhov")
  resolves to its referent and is supported; an EXTENSION ("Pierre
  Bezukhov" where the material only ever wrote "Pierre") is model-supplied
  content wearing a resolved name, and is refused. The genuinely disjoint
  alias ("Peter Kirílovich") is model-tier, typed as a gap by the engine
  itself, and closes only through a received prior with a named giver —
  the resolver is that prior's seam, not its substitute.

**Evidence:** the War and Peace run of 2026-08-16 (five false "not in the
material" flags on real names), and the engine's own history — a blanket
combining-mark strip was tried and reverted in `surfaces.js` for silently
claiming cross-script generality (II.13).
**Enforced:** `grounding.test.mjs` — the fold-both-sides regression and the
cast-resolution test, which runs against the engine's real organs and pins
the asymmetry.

## P12 — Every sentence stands on a named ground

There is no "ungrounded content" in a rendered answer; that framing was the
mistake. There are two grounds — THE MATERIAL (an address into the bytes,
cited or attribution-earned) and THE MODEL (its own voice, typed as such) —
and every sentence is classified onto one, mechanically, from checks the
turn already ran (`provenance.js` reads `attribute()` and `checkGrounding()`
output; it measures nothing fresh). Orthogonal to the ground is the stripe:
a sentence committing to figures or names the material does not hold is a
claim of fact on model authority, drawn with the warning stripe whichever
ground it stands on — a cited sentence that drifted shows both facts at
once. The renderer keeps the grounds visually distinct (IV.4): material
plain with its address, model-voice dotted, claims striped.

**Named future work, not implied by the word "grounded":** relation-level
reading — the hypergraph tier, where "Pierre married Dolokhov" fails with
every token present because the text never bound that edge. The organs are
the engine's (`extractRelations`, the binding nulls); until they are wired,
sentence-level ground plus atom-level stripes is what this instrument
actually checks, and it says so.

**Evidence:** the live dialogue run's first turn — gemma2:2b called Pierre
"the main character in Anna Karenina"; the stripe machinery flagged Anna
Karenina and Leo Tolstoy as not-in-the-material on the record while the
legitimate sentences attributed to Pierre's actual introduction chapter.
**Enforced:** `provenance.test.mjs`, including the orthogonality case
(cited AND striped), and the IV.4 row in `constitution.js`'s map.

## P13 — Work done twice becomes code; the model proposes, the gate disposes

L5 extended from facts to work. A procedure the instrument has performed once
may be deposited as a SKILL — executable code with declared slots, declared
anchors, declared organ needs, and its own check — and from then on the model
does as little as possible, in a ladder whose every descent is a typed `open`
entry: (1) a saved skill claims the task mechanically (all anchors in the
task's own words, most-specific wins, ties refused as ambiguous) and its
slots fill from the task's own words — zero model calls; (2) slots the task
does not determine are filled by ONE grammar-constrained call and validated
mechanically before anything runs; (3) no claim, and the task runs the way it
always did. Five walls hold this up:

- **The body is code the model never executes, sees at runtime, or edits in
  place.** The model touches a skill at two seams only: slot values
  (validated, basis-tagged "task" or "model" — a model-filled slot is a
  disclosed authority, P7's class) and candidate authoring.
- **Admission is P10 made mechanical.** A candidate without its own check is
  refused as a wish; a check that fails against the candidate's own body in
  the real sandbox refuses admission; the refusal lands ON the log with its
  reason, because "tried and refused" is evidence.
- **Authority is granted, never ambient.** A body runs in an empty vm context
  with exactly the organs it declared and was granted; the forbidden-token
  scan refuses at admission what the sandbox would not hand over. Stated
  honestly: this is an authority wall by construction, not a hardened
  security boundary — P1 is the outer wall.
- **The library is a log** (P3's discipline): admit / supersede / retract /
  invoke / refuse, folded to a live library, rebuilt from the record alone;
  bodies live content-addressed in `skills/<digest>.json`, identity is the
  digest of the mechanism (provenance rides the entry, not the identity),
  and bytes that stop matching their digest drop from the live fold as a
  typed defect, never trusted silently.
- **Provenance is measured, not claimed.** A run's refs are harvested from
  what its granted organs actually returned; budgets (run, check, stack
  depth) are named backstops whose overrun is a typed refusal.

**Evidence:** the session of 2026-08-16 — two models ignoring the cite
instruction (L5's own record) generalizes: anything reusable left as prose
instructions is re-derived or drifted on every use, while the same procedure
as gated code runs identically forever and costs zero tokens.
**Enforced:** `skills.test.mjs` — the wish refusal, the token scan, the
check-must-pass gate, the ambiguity refusal, the zero-model-call skill path,
the typed descent, organ-grant denial, budget overruns, stacking with
dependency-order admission, and the digest-mismatch drop on reload.

*Established 2026-08-16, alongside the holonic layer, the constitution
channel, and the local-only excision. The lineage evidence cited here was
gathered by a five-reader sweep across eochat, eochatX, eoWebLLM, and the
engine; the full brief is preserved in that session's task output.*
