// What must hold: this module runs on the SAME declared numbers reflex.js
// already named givers for, not a second set; the meter runs against the
// ENGINE'S REAL ORGANS (eoreader6 emergence/tiers.js), not a stub, the same
// discipline reflex.test.mjs and grounding.test.mjs already set; the first
// arrival is a typed gap exactly as SEED.md #1 requires, same as the self
// plane's own meter; and the entropy reading actually responds to what it
// claims to measure — repeating one sentence must not widen the ground, a
// genuinely foreign one must — checked, not asserted.
