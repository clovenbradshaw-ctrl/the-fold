// arrangement.test.mjs — end1/label/end2, added alongside subject/verb/object.
// A SEPARATE file on purpose, the same precedent hyperlexicon-stance.test.mjs
// and hypergraph-vocabulary-candidates.test.mjs already established:
// hypergraph.test.mjs reaches the engine through ../eoreader7/legacy-eoreader6.1,
// an uninitialised submodule in this checkout, so a case appended there would
// silently never execute. This tests against eoreader7's real NATIVE organs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The grammar-lens work already said the arrangement itself
// is earned as "an ordered first end, a label, an ordered second end," and
// that `subject`/`verb`/`object` are the SAE-grammar READING of it — a
// declared overlay, not the ground truth. But the STORED shape never held
// that distinction: every edge and claim in this file is keyed literally
// `.subject`/`.verb`/`.object`, at four separate construction sites
// (the primary edge loop, `judge()`, `edgeFace()`, and the `unheard`-verdict
// claim). `arrangementOf(t)` is the one place that maps a triple onto its
// earned names; used at all four sites so the mapping cannot drift the way
// four independent literals eventually would (this file's own history:
// DEF/EVA's `Array.find`, `synthesize`'s `String.includes`).
//
// ADDITIVE, NOT A RENAME. `subject`/`verb`/`object` are untouched at every
// site; `end1`/`label`/`end2` are added beside them. Migrating a consumer
// off the SAE names is real, scoped, future work (221 call sites across 22
// files, at last count) — not attempted here.

// These four tests were the TRANSITION's own assertions: both name sets
// present and equal on every construction site, so consumers could migrate
// one at a time against a stable double-carriage. P76's amendment finished
// the consumer migration; this pass removed the old names from the four
// sites. The tests now assert the END STATE — earned names present and
// real, SAE names GONE — so a re-introduction of the double carriage fails
// loudly instead of drifting back in.
