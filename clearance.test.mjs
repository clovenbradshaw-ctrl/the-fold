// clearance.test.mjs — NUL·Figure's conformance: the establishment ladder
// against the REAL eoreader7 native adapters, no stubs. Every wall is shown
// to FIRE, not merely to exist (a wall nothing can trigger is a comment —
// R17), and every clearing standing is shown reachable.
//
// Fixtures carry ground truth BY CONSTRUCTION, declared before the run
// (the falsification-probe discipline). The ambiguity fixture reuses the
// adapter's own proven specimen shape (rich-referents.test.js's
// two-bearer construction) with this repo's names — the adapter's own
// conformance test declares {minPartners: 2, minSentences: 1} at fixture
// scale because the derived fences are book-scale statistics, and this
// file declares the same, echoed on the result.
