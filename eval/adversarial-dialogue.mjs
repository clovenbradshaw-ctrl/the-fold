// eval/adversarial-dialogue.mjs — two mouths, two folds, two belief graphs.
//
// dialogue.mjs runs one asker and one answerer against a fixed corpus. This
// runs two OPPOSED speakers against each other: each gets its own fold
// instance (fold.js's own state shape, unmodified — "context stays bounded
// per speaker exactly the way it already is for one"), its own accumulated
// utterances as its own retrieval corpus (source.js's retrieve(), reused
// verbatim), and its own evolving belief graph (hypergraph.js's
// makeRelationReader, reused verbatim — the material fed to it is simply
// the speaker's own words this time, not a book).
//
// What this measures, per the brief this implements: not that the speakers
// sound like they are engaging (gameable — a model that has learned what
// engagement sounds like passes that test for free) but that a SPECIFIC
// edge in one speaker's graph shows up, mechanically, in the other's graph
// afterward and survives to the transcript's own last turn — or is
// explicitly contradicted, and THAT survives. dialogue-graph.js is the one
// new instrument this required; everything else here is the same organs
// dialogue.mjs already threads together, run twice.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (state it here, not just in the report): a
// surviving edge shows a graph changed and traces to a specific prior
// utterance. It does not and cannot show WHY — model reasoning versus a
// small model's general tendency to drift toward whatever it last read
// under adversarial framing is beyond this instrument's reach, the same way
// an unresolved pronoun is beyond hypergraph.js's reach today.

/**
 * The deeper failure exact-repeat detection cannot see: measured live on
 * BOTH topics (Napoleon's 1812 campaign, then independently the atomic-
 * bombings debate), gemma2:2b drifted into sycophantic-opener + vague,
 * referent-poor abstraction — "a pressure cooker," "a confluence of
 * factors" — that starves hypergraph.js's own extractor down to zero
 * measurable edges, turn after turn, with NOTHING literally repeated. A
 * second NL-pattern detector (a "sycophantic opener" regex, a vagueness
 * score) would be exactly the un-universal patch this instrument's own
 * design already argues against — so this reuses the SAME structural
 * instrument the whole harness already stands on, dialogue-graph.js's own
 * edgesMatch, one step earlier in the pipeline than its usual post-hoc use.
 *
 * The gate: does the candidate reply's own OWN newly-extracted edges add
 * anything the speaker's own immediately-prior turn did not already
 * establish? Not "does this turn have few edges" — hypergraph.js's own
 * stated philosophy is that low structure is a typed gap, not
 * automatically a defect (a turn can legitimately have little new to
 * say), and gating on an absolute floor would punish exactly the honest,
 * modest turns that philosophy protects. Gating on "strictly no edge not
 * already in the immediately-prior snapshot" targets only genuine
 * standstill — the graph did not move at all — which a legitimately thin
 * but NEW turn does not trigger (any single fresh, resolvable claim clears
 * it), and an empty-of-content turn does (nothing to compare, nothing new
 * to find).
 *
 * Amended (measured live, this pass): the ORIGINAL order bailed out at the
 * top the moment `priorEdges` was already empty — "nothing established yet
 * to have failed to add to" — which reads as correct for the COMPARISON
 * question but silently also skipped the STRUCTURAL-ZERO question one line
 * below, the one question that needs no prior baseline at all. Replayed
 * offline against this repo's own saved v3-edgegate transcript
 * (eval/results/adversarial-dialogue-hiroshima-gemma2b-v3-edgegate.jsonl):
 * both speakers hit zero edges by turn 8/9 and stayed at zero every single
 * turn through the transcript's end (turn 18) — exactly the disclosed limit
 * ("once a speaker's own prior turn already has ZERO edges, this check has
 * nothing left to compare against and goes silent"), confirmed turn by
 * turn, not just asserted. The candidate's own edge count is now computed
 * FIRST and checked unconditionally — "this turn extracted nothing" is a
 * structural zero/non-zero fact about the candidate ALONE, not a magnitude
 * floor (hypergraph.js's own "low structure is a typed gap, not
 * automatically a defect" is about a turn having FEW edges, never about a
 * turn having verifiably NONE) — so it no longer goes blind exactly where
 * the collapse this instrument exists to catch actually lives. The
 * subset-of-prior comparison still only runs, and can only run, once there
 * is a real prior baseline to compare against.
