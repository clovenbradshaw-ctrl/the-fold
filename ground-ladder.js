// ground-ladder.js — where a sentence stands, read off the whole cube,
// unconsciously (P115). Pure.
//
// User direction (2026-09-05): "it's not well cited … if the model is
// saying it itself, cite the model name", then "have it fully leverage the
// cube unconsciously". A sentence's ground is not one bit (material /
// model): it is the highest rung a ladder of terrains can place it on, and
// every rung is something the instrument already computes. The ladder,
// top down, each rung its cell (the canon stays backstage — the reader
// sees plain words and addresses, never a cell):
//
//   bound      CON·Figure  (Link)     the relation tier bound a claim on it → the edge's own byte address
//   witnessed  EVA·Figure  (Lens)     the sentence witness pointed at a passage that states it → that passage
//   recorded   SYN·Figure  (Link/Network) its claim is a note on the ledger → the note's witnesses, by source
//   derived    SYN·Pattern (Paradigm) it states a fact derived on the record → the premises' ids
//   contested  CON·Figure·CONTESTED   its claim is under a live dispute → both sides, named
//   named      SIG·Ground  (Entity)   its names resolve to referents the material establishes, the claim does not → where they are established
//   self       the mouth              nothing read places it: it is the model's own testimony, cited by name (P39: self:model is a witness with a name)
//
// A rung is a finding only when its organ REACHED the sentence (THE-NULL-
// STATES law 3): a witness that was never asked is not a refusal, and the
// ladder says which rungs were skipped.
//
// THE STANDING RULE BETWEEN ANY TWO RUNGS (user direction, 2026-09-09):
// the LOW sets the POSSIBILITY for the HIGH; the HIGH sets the PROBABILITY
// for the LOW. A weaker rung's own mechanism is a floor a stronger rung's
// verdict may never contradict — tier 4 ("derived") answers "is this
// referent even the one the sentence names" by asking tier 6's own
// resolveName before crediting a match, so a stronger claim can never
// override what a weaker rung has already established as impossible (two
// distinct, named referents are not quietly folded into one because their
// surnames share a token). This is a CONSISTENCY constraint, checked here,
// not a comparison of confidence — it costs nothing to enforce and is
// applied every time a higher rung reads through a lower one's organ.
// The reverse — a stronger rung CALIBRATING how much weight the weaker
// rung's own signal deserves, e.g. how often "named" turns out correct
// measured against cases where "bound" was also reachable for the same
// claim — is a real, disclosed, UNMEASURED question. Nothing in this file
// assigns a numeric probability to any rung; inventing one without a
// measurement (this repo's own standing rule, generality-gate discipline,
// applied here) would be worse than leaving it named and open. A rung
// added later inherits both halves: it must respect every rung already
// below it as a possibility floor, and its own reliability against the
// rungs above it is something to measure, never assume.
