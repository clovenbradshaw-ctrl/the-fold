// cube unconsciously". A sentence's ground is not one bit (material /
// model): it is the highest rung a ladder of terrains can place it on, and
// every rung is something the instrument already computes. The ladder,
// top down, each rung its cell (the canon stays backstage — the reader
// sees plain words and addresses, never a cell):
//
//   verbatim   SIG·Ground  (Entity)   the material's own bytes state this sentence verbatim → that passage
//   bound      CON·Figure  (Link)     the relation tier bound a claim on it → the edge's own byte address
//   witnessed  EVA·Figure  (Lens)     the sentence witness pointed at a passage that states it → that passage
//   recorded   SYN·Figure  (Link/Network) its claim is a note on the ledger → the note's witnesses, by source
//   derived    SYN·Pattern (Paradigm) it states a fact derived on the record → the premises' ids
//   contested  CON·Figure·CONTESTED   its claim is under a live dispute → both sides, named
//   named      SIG·Ground  (Entity)   its names resolve to referents the material establishes, the claim does not → where they are established
//   self       the mouth              nothing read places it: it is the model's own testimony, cited by name (P39: self:model is a witness with a name)
//
// A rung is a finding only when its organ REACHED the sentence (THE-NULL-
// STATES law 3): a witness that was never asked is not a refusal, and the
// ladder says which rungs were skipped.
//
// THE STANDING RULE BETWEEN ANY TWO RUNGS (user direction, 2026-09-09):
// the LOW sets the POSSIBILITY for the HIGH; the HIGH sets the PROBABILITY
// for the LOW. A weaker rung's own mechanism is a floor a stronger rung's
// verdict may never contradict — tier 4 ("derived") answers "is this
// referent even the one the sentence names" by asking tier 6's own
// resolveName before crediting a match, so a stronger claim can never
// override what a weaker rung has already established as impossible (two
// distinct, named referents are not quietly folded into one because their
// surnames share a token). This is a CONSISTENCY constraint, checked here,
// not a comparison of confidence — it costs nothing to enforce and is
// applied every time a higher rung reads through a lower one's organ.
// The reverse — a stronger rung CALIBRATING how much weight the weaker
// rung's own signal deserves, e.g. how often "named" turns out correct
// measured against cases where "bound" was also reachable for the same
// claim — is a real, disclosed, UNMEASURED question. Nothing in this file
// assigns a numeric probability to any rung; inventing one without a
// measurement (this repo's own standing rule, generality-gate discipline,
// applied here) would be worse than leaving it named and open. A rung
// added later inherits both halves: it must respect every rung already
// below it as a possibility floor, and its own reliability against the
// rungs above it is something to measure, never assume.
// TONE-MARK COLLISION (P251, closed here): the blanket combining-mark strip
// below (U+0300-U+036F, "the entire Combining Diacritical Marks block") is
// right for the accent-decoration languages it was built for (French,
// Spanish, German, Portuguese...) and WRONG for a tonal language, where the
// identical codepoint (e.g. U+0301 acute) is the phonemic distinction
// itself, not a decoration on it — Vietnamese's five tone marks (grave
// U+0300, acute U+0301, tilde U+0303, hook-above U+0309, dot-below U+0323)
// and Pinyin's four (U+0300/U+0301/U+0304 macron/U+030C caron) all sit
// inside the stripped range, so "Nguyễn" and "Nguyên" folded to the same
// string — a different-toned name read as the material's own verbatim
// words. eoreader7's own referent-identity fold (adapters/text/
// surfaces.js::diaNorm) already drew this exact line and stated why in its
// own header: it folds only five NAMED Latin-vowel accent characters,
// deliberately never touches Vietnamese tone marks "because they carry
// phonemic/grammatical content rather than accent decoration," and records
// that a blanket combining-mark strip was tried there and reverted for the
// same reason. A codepoint-only blacklist cannot resolve this alone (the
// same U+0301 is safe to fold in French and unsafe in Vietnamese/Pinyin),
// so the exclusion is LANGUAGE-scoped: `TONAL_LANGUAGES` is a small,
// giver-named registry (mirroring eoreader7 S39's `PRONOUN_PRIORS`
// per-language pattern) of which languages carry load-bearing tone marks
// in this exact codepoint range; a declared `language` in `groundOf`'s ctx
// consults it, and everything is byte-identical to before when no language
// is declared (today's callers all omit it). Generality: the underlying
// principle (tone is phonemic, not decorative, in these languages) is

  // holograph comparison, not a string one. When either side has no

    // `toks(text).every(...)` running over an EMPTY array — vacuously true
    // by JS's own semantics, for ANY candidate sentence, correct referent or
    // not. A falsification workflow (2026-09-22) confirmed this promoted a

    // MATCH, not a false mismatch). A structural corroboration floor
    // (`d.premises.length >= 2`, this repo's own reused ≥2 convention —
    // WITNESS_FLOOR, FORM_MIN_ARRIVALS, EVIDENCE_FLOOR) was tried here as a

    // specimen, to be insufficient: a genuinely composed "derived" fact
    // structurally rests on ≥2 parent premises by construction (composition
    // always chains a left AND a right edge), so the adversarial control in
    // that specimen already clears premises.length >= 2 — the same as the
    // true specimen, since both checks read the identical `d`. A predicate
    // that only reads `d` (never the candidate `text`/`sentence` pair) can
    // never discriminate which referent a bare pronoun actually names; only
    // real coreference resolution could, and none is wired into this ctx
    // (namesIn deliberately excludes bare pronouns from resolution, L2).
    // Rather than invent a floor that measurably does not close the hole

    // this refuses outright whenever there is nothing to confirm — always,
    // never conditionally reopened on corroboration count alone.
