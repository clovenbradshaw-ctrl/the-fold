// grounding.js — is every checkable claim in this answer actually in the bytes?
//
// Ported from eochatX's app/client/eo-citation-check.ts (itself a port of
// eoWebLLM's, itself a port of eochat's server/citation-check.js). The
// organising idea is unchanged: a claim attached to material must be backed by
// bytes that material actually contains, and that is checked mechanically —
// string containment — for the two things a model most often invents, numbers
// and proper names. It never judges whether an uncited claim is true.
//
// This complements what was already here. `checkCitations` in source.js checks
// ADDRESSES: did the answer cite something it was handed. `attribute` in
// cite.js attaches an address where the model wrote none. Neither looks inside
// the sentence. This does: it pulls the figures and names out of the answer and
// asks whether the material says them at all. Together they answer three
// different questions, and a record built from all three can say what a turn
// established, where, and what it made up.
//
// What was left behind, and why: eochatX's file carries an inline void-marker
// renderer, a "did you mean" corrector, citation snippeting, a polarity check,
// evasion detection, multi-ground cross-checking and a re-surf resolver. All of
// them serve UI surfaces or pipeline stages this app does not have. Porting
// them would be assuming complexity rather than earning it.
//
// Pure: no DOM, no IO, no model.

 * claim, not context that should gate this one.
 *
 * Two things this is NOT, each ruled out by a live test case rather than
 * assumed. (1) Not applied to NAME atoms: grounding.test.mjs's "an
 * invented figure, agency and year are each caught" wraps a REAL name
 * around a FABRICATED predicate — "The Kessington Report gave a figure of
 * 21 percent" — and the two share no words with the source at all (the
 * report was "commissioned", never "gave a figure"); requiring the real
 * name's company to include the fabrication's own words made the real
 * name fail too. A multi-word name phrase already carries its own
 * specificity (PROPER_RE's run-of-capitals) and, in checkGrounding, a
 * referent-resolution rescue — a bare "30" has neither, and is the
 * single-token, zero-context case this instrument had no defense for. (2)
 * Not narrowed to the number's nearest neighbour word: a first version
 * tried that, and a row-group answer ("The case_number column lists
 * 24-0011 for Gary IN PD") failed it — the words immediately beside "24"
 * are the model's own narrative gloss ("column", "lists"), absent from
 * the terse CSV row itself, while the genuinely matching word
 * ("case_number", from the header) sits three words back. Company is an
 * OR-match (`numberSupporters` below): a passage sentence must hold ONE
 * of these words, so a larger company set only widens what CAN pass — it
 * never lets an unrelated passage sentence pass on padding alone, because
 * an unrelated sentence about something else typically shares NONE of a
 * claim's real vocabulary (measured in the trazodone case this fix was
 * built against: an adversarial passage mentioning "30 dogs" shares no
 * word with "trazodone... 30 to 60 minutes" and is correctly refused).
 * "Sentence" is the locality unit — structural, the same boundary this
 * file already uses everywhere else — never a hand-picked token count
 * (P4's open debt, CLAUDE.md: ROWS_PER_CHUNK, NULL_SAMPLES and friends are
 * already named there as constants that should be derived, not tuned).
 *
 * Disclosed residue, and the real next step (POLICIES.md P26 has the full
 * writeup): "sentence" is a structural boundary, not a tuned token count,
 * but it is still a HAND-CHOSEN unit — the same class of debt P4 already
 * names for ROWS_PER_CHUNK/NULL_SAMPLES. The sharper design, named but not
 * built: a word's universe here is bounded by how many hops out you can
 * go (nearest word → next word → ... → whole sentence → adjacent
 * sentence) before an additional hop stops moving the verdict beyond what
 * a retrieval-drawn null of unrelated candidate company would move it by
 * chance — nul/index.js's pattern() ("a difference that makes a
 * difference"), asked a question it has never been asked. Not attempted
 * here: that null needs its own design and its own measurement before it
 * earns a name, and a claimed null test that was not actually validated
 * would be worse than this honest, disclosed heuristic.

 * plain question with no material attached ("what percentage of Earth's
 * atmosphere is nitrogen...") produced zero proof-seeking chips — not
 * because proof-seeking was off, but because `findings` never had anything
 * in it to offer, since checkGrounding correctly declines to examine
 * against an index that does not exist. With no material, every atom is
 * trivially unsupported by definition, so this mirrors checkGrounding's own
 * atom scan without the index comparison. Same finding shape, so an
 * existing consumer of `findings` (proofTargets, unsupportedClaims) needs
