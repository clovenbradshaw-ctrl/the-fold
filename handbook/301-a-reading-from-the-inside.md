**Why this matters:** every idea in Parts I and II has been abstract so far —
grounds, figures, terrains, stances. This chapter walks one real, short,
already-produced answer through the whole machine, act by act, so you can
see all of it land on one concrete case before Part III breaks the organs
apart individually.

## The question and the answer

At some point, EO Chat was asked: *"What does Victor Frankenstein feel
toward the creature he made?"* It answered with one paragraph:

> Victor Frankenstein's feelings toward his creation are one of intense
> hatred and abhorrence. He is consumed by a desire for revenge against the
> being he brought into existence, whom he views as a monster and an
> outcast. In a fit of rage, Victor kills the creature after it threatens to
> harm him, demonstrating the depth of his emotional turmoil and the
> destructive nature of his creation. [1]

Below it, one citation: `pg84.txt @ bytes 263105–265217`, with the actual
quoted text from the book attached. Below *that*, a section titled "What
this leaves out."

## Reading it the way this book has taught you to

Nothing in that paragraph is a guess. The system had to build a ground —
retrieve the passages in the book that a fresh comparison against "what's
typically here" would flag as relevant to the question — and only some of
what it found survived. Look at what the answer's own report says happened
to the rest:

- **13 matched passages exceeded the fold budget and were dropped, not
  truncated.** Not summarized down to fit — set aside entirely, because a
  passage cut down to fit a size limit is a different, unlabeled kind of
  loss than a passage honestly excluded. Chapter 3.5 gives this distinction
  its full due; for now, notice that the system is already telling you
  which kind of loss happened.
- **One retrieved passage was dropped because "90% of its content words
  were not carried by its evidence."** That's Chapter 1.3's witness gate,
  operating on a whole candidate passage rather than a single fact: most of
  what that passage would have asserted wasn't actually backed by anything
  the system could point to, so it didn't get to stand in the answer — the
  report says so, by name, rather than silently leaving it out.
- **What actually made it into the paragraph came from exactly one
  surviving passage**, cited down to the byte range it came from. That's
  the one piece of testimony that earned witness: a real figure, backed by
  real evidence, that the system was willing to speak about.

## An old discipline this resembles, and where it stops resembling it

Literary scholarship has its own long-standing name for reading this
closely and accounting for exactly what's used and what's set aside: close
reading, the practice mid-twentieth-century critics like the New Critics
built into a method — attend only to what's actually on the page, resist
filling gaps with outside biography or assumption, and be able to point to
the specific words a claim rests on. The Frankenstein answer above does
something structurally similar: it doesn't reach for what everyone already
assumes about Frankenstein, it reaches for one particular passage and
reports exactly what got left out along the way.

The resemblance stops at method, not result. Close reading is a human
critical practice aimed at richer interpretation, argued in prose, judged
by other readers. What you just watched is a measurement — a passage
either cleared the witness gate or it didn't, reported with a byte range
rather than a critical argument. Both refuse to answer from assumption
alone. Only one of them is a formal test with a computable outcome.

## What "reading" meant, here, end to end

Nothing about this required the system to have any general opinion about
Frankenstein, or about hatred, or about creators and their creations. It
required building a ground from the actual book, checking what stood out
against that ground, discarding whatever didn't survive contact with real
evidence, and reporting — not hiding — exactly how much got discarded and
why. The single sentence you read as an answer is the tip of a much larger,
fully-accounted-for process, and the accounting is not an afterthought
bolted onto the answer. It's the same discipline from Part I, run once, on
one real question, with the receipts kept.

You'll see this exact example again: Chapter 3.5 uses its "What this leaves
out" section to explain refusal properly, and Part V uses it again to walk
the citation itself all the way back to the real bytes it came from.

**Where this comes from:** `eochat/essay.md`, in full — a real, already-
produced answer from the running system, including its own citation and its
own "What this leaves out" accounting. The close-reading connection above
is this book's own added link to literary-critical practice, not something
the codebase itself cites.
