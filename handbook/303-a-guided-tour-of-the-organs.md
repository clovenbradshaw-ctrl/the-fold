**Why this matters:** Part I taught you one move, and Part II taught you the
grammar every act is described in. This chapter introduces the actual
working parts — this system's word for them is **organs** — that carry the
move out. You don't need to remember every organ's internals. You need one
clear sentence per organ: what it does, and what it refuses to do.

## `nul` — perceiving by difference

This is the organ that performs Chapter 1.1's move directly: building a
ground by perturbing what's present, then measuring what stands out
against it. Everything else in this system either depends on `nul` having
already run, or is a variation on the same underlying idea. What it refuses
to do: judge anything against a fixed, pre-set baseline. Every ground it
builds is disposable and rebuilt for the occasion — never kept around as a
permanent yardstick.

## `frame` — keeping its own trail

`frame` holds a record of the engine's own acts, in order — which ground
was built, from what, citing what came before. It exists partly to answer
a genuinely hard question honestly: can a system's own record-keeping
watch itself, all the way down? The answer here is a firm, deliberate
"no, and it doesn't try to." An organ that read its own trail, and then
another organ that read *that* organ's trail, would just be a clock reading
its own arithmetic — no level of watching fixes it, each new layer just
reads its own sums. So `frame` refuses that regress outright: a
freshly-built ground can never be the first act of a trail, which means a
live reading can't start recording itself reading. What it refuses to do:
pretend to a completeness about its own self-awareness that would actually
require an infinite stack of watchers to deliver.

## `temporality` — finding order and direction, honestly

`temporality` asks two separable questions about a sequence, and is
careful never to blur them: **is the order load-bearing at all** (would
scrambling it actually destroy something), and **does it run one direction
and not the other** (is going forward distinguishable from going
backward). What it refuses to do is the tempting third question — is this
order actually *time*. That claim has to come from whoever handed the
material in, or has to be independently earned by finding actual evidence
of things like memory, duration, or irreversibility doing real work in the
content. An ordering can be real and directional without this organ ever
calling it "temporal" by assumption.

## The binding organ — finding relationships without reading a single word

This organ (its file is literally named `emergence/binding.js`) measures
whether two things showed up together more often than chance would predict
— using nothing but *where* things arrived, never *what* they are. It
never reads a surface, a word, or a sentence. It works purely on arrival
positions, which is what makes it "modality-blind": the same mechanism
that finds a relationship between two characters in a novel could, in
principle, find one between two entities in an audio recording, because it
never needed to know what either one was made of. What it refuses to do:
say what a relationship *means*. It reports that two things are linked, and
in which direction one seems to drive the other — meaning, if it comes, is
somebody else's job.

## Two old philosophical problems these organs are built to dodge

Splitting the work into separate organs, each with one job and one
explicit refusal, has a real cousin in philosophy of mind: Jerry Fodor's
1983 book *The Modularity of Mind* argued that at least some mental
processes are handled by dedicated, encapsulated modules — each one fast,
specialized, and unable to see or be second-guessed by the others'
internal workings — rather than by one general-purpose reasoning process
doing everything. `nul`, `frame`, `temporality`, and the binding organ, each
with a one-line job and a one-line refusal, are the same design instinct:
narrow, specialized competence instead of one thing that tries to do
everything.

`frame`'s refusal to watch its own trail is worth naming against an older
problem still: the **homunculus regress**, a standard objection in
philosophy of perception. If seeing requires a little person inside your
head looking at an image on your retina, then how does *that* homunculus
see — do you need a smaller homunculus inside its head, and so on forever?
Any theory that explains a capacity by positing a smaller version of the
same capacity watching it has explained nothing; it's just pushed the
question back one layer. `frame` refuses this exact trap by construction,
declining to let a ground be the first act of its own trail, rather than
declaring the regress solved and hoping nobody checks.

## Four more organs, honestly under-described

This book can also point you to the *names* `discourse`, `formation`,
`verdict`, and `cascade`, and to a little of what they're for: `verdict` is
where a claim actually gets made — and, crucially, where it stays
revisable rather than final. `cascade` is where a refused candidate's
standing gets recorded so a later attempt doesn't have to re-litigate a
settled "no" from scratch. But this book doesn't yet have a source passage
detailed enough to teach either one, or `discourse` or `formation`,
properly — the same honesty this book asked of the source material in
Chapter 1.1 onward applies to itself here. Better an honest "not yet
covered" than a confident-sounding paragraph this book couldn't actually
back with a citation.

**Where this comes from:** `nul` is the organ performing the operation set
out across `eoreader6/SEED.md`, "One operation" and "The unit of record."
`frame` and its refusal of the self-watching regress are from SEED.md
Amendment VIII, *"an organ that reads the reading's own trail, then an organ that reads that organ, collapses into a clock reading its own arithmetic... The frame refuses the regress by type."* `temporality`'s
three-way distinction (ordered / directional / temporal) is from Amendment
V, *"Order is measured. Time may be received, discovered, or remain
unresolved."* The binding organ is from Amendment X, *"It is modality-blind
by construction: it reads arrival positions, never surfaces, never words,
never a language... Meaning, when it comes, is earned by higher organs."*
`verdict` and `cascade` are named in `eoreader6/CUBE.md` line 120 and in
several places across SEED.md's amendments (e.g. Amendment XV, *"the same
standing `cascade` already holds"*), without a passage this book found
sufficient to teach them fully. The Fodor and homunculus-regress
connections above are this book's own added links to philosophy of mind,
not something the codebase itself cites.

**Byte anchors** (generated — `node scripts/anchor-quotes.mjs`, verified by `--verify`; sources and their provenance in `sources/MANIFEST.json`). Each anchor is the UTF-8 byte range of the quoted words in the snapshot the manifest names:

- “an organ that reads the reading's own trail,…” → `eoreader6/SEED.md#b30423-30554`, `eoreader6/SEED.md#b30758-30795`
- “Order is measured. Time may be received, discovered,…” → `eoreader6/SEED.md#b21794-21867`
- “It is modality-blind by construction: it reads arrival…” → `eoreader6/SEED.md#b33840-33951`, `eoreader6/SEED.md#b34106-34156`
- “the same standing `cascade` already holds” → `eoreader6/SEED.md#b40568-40609`

Quoted spans **not located in any obtained source** and not explained by a known gap — each is either the book's own illustrative speech, or a passage that reads as verbatim and is not, which is itself a finding to resolve:

- “no, and it doesn't try to.”
