// Two tiers, deliberately: (1) direct-edge unit tests giving precise
// control over ground truth — refuted vs. candidate vs. underpowered vs.
// the trap (looks unrefuted on a small stage, refuted on a larger one);
// (2) ONE end-to-end run through the REAL relation reader and REAL
// grammar lens over prose invented for this file, never Wikipedia, never
// a famous text. That second tier exists on purpose and should not be
// skipped or replaced with more of the first: the whole discipline this
// module is built to survive is "it worked on famous material, which
// proves nothing about whether it's reading structure or riding
// familiarity" — the same test a cast-list extractor needs run against
// an invented play rather than Hamlet. War and Peace, where this
// mechanism was first tried, could be memorized; nothing below can be.
