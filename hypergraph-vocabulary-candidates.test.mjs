// hypergraph-vocabulary-candidates.test.mjs — vocabulary.candidates, a
// SEPARATE file on purpose: hypergraph.test.mjs reaches the engine through
// ../eoreader7/legacy-eoreader6.1, an uninitialised submodule in this
// checkout, so a case appended there would silently never execute (the same
// precedent hyperlexicon-stance.test.mjs already established). This tests
// against eoreader7's real NATIVE organs instead — a real sibling here.
//
// WHY THIS FIELD EXISTS. Found by an adversarial audit of a real reading
// anomaly (live_priors' scripts/eot-sidecar.mjs, the SBLGNT — Greek New
// Testament critical-apparatus format — reading `edgesFound: 0`):
// `vocabulary.verbs: 0` reads IDENTICALLY whether `discoverRelationVocab`
// nominated genuinely ZERO candidates (an apparatus/table/record-block
// shape, no token ever recurring after a surface) or nominated real
// candidates that simply never cleared `minSurfaces` — two different facts
// about the material a caller could not previously tell apart from
// `vocabulary` alone. `candidates` is `discovered.candidates.length`,
// carried onto BOTH the early-return/empty shapes and the real outer return
// of `relationsFor` — purely additive, no change to `edges`/`examined`/any
// admission-path logic.
//
// AN HONEST RESIDUE, MEASURED HERE RATHER THAN ASSUMED: under
// live_priors' own eot-sidecar.mjs recipe (MIN_SURFACES_PER_VERB = 1, no
// classifyConnector/posPrior injected), `discoverRelationVocab`'s own
// `verbDominant` gate defaults to `true` whenever no posPrior is supplied
// (relations.js: `!posPrior || ...`), and every nominated candidate has
// `seenAfter.size >= 1` by construction — so under THAT exact
// configuration `candidates.length === verbs.size` ALWAYS, and this field
// does not, by itself, distinguish the SBLGNT case from ordinary prose at
// the sidecar's own gate. The general mechanism is still real (a caller
// with a higher `minSurfaces` or a real posPrior DOES see divergence — the
// last case below proves it directly against `discoverRelationVocab` itself),
// and
// the field is honest and harmless either way — this file pins BOTH the
// real divergent case and the no-divergence-under-this-recipe fact, so a
// future reader does not have to re-discover either.
