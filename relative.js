// relative.js — an experiment: addresses that are relative, resolution by state.
//
// Everything the record holds today is reached by an ABSOLUTE address: a seq
// in a ledger, `name#start-end` into a source's bytes, an mxc in a media
// store. That is a graph database's way — a key, a lookup, exact or nothing.
// A brain has no such keys. A neuron is where its connections put it, a
// memory is a pattern the network settles into from a partial cue, and an
// address is only ever RELATIVE: to the cue that is active now, or to the
// neighbour one step away.
//
// This module is that other way, kept pure so it can be measured:
//
//   sdrOf(text)         a sparse distributed representation — the "state"
//                       a text puts the field into: which of n bits it lights
//   Field               nodes with NO keys. The only ways in are recall(cue)
//                       — start from a state and let activation spread until
//                       it settles — and after(node)/before(node), one
//                       synapse along. There is no get(id). There is no id.
//   nullBand(field, …)  what a cue of that length pulls out of this field by
//                       chance: measured with random cues, never chosen
//   serialize()         nodes with their neighbours named by signature, not
//                       by position, so a re-ordered or re-numbered store
//                       rebuilds the same field
//
// And the third thing the two ways of addressing make between them — the
// Pattern over the Ground and the Figure: `reanchor` and `drift` in
// relative-pattern.js, which take an absolute address and a figure recalled
// from the same bytes and say whether they still agree, and mint the ground
// address anew from the figure when they do not.
//
// Structural constants, stated: n = 4096 bits per state; a token lights one
// bit. Density is whatever the text makes it; overlap is cosine over bits,
// so long and short texts compare on one scale. No activation threshold is
// chosen anywhere — the null band decides what counts as a recall.

// The width is set by hand in the relative-address experiment (P130, 2026-09-07) as a structural size, never a cut: nothing is decided against it.
