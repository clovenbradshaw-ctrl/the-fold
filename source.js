// boundaries, every chunk knows its byte range, and retrieval is mechanical
// term overlap. No model chooses anything here.
//
// Two rules this module exists to obey:
//   - The model does not get tools. Whether a turn retrieves is a
//     deterministic function of the question's own words, not a decision the
//     model makes.
//   - Whatever cannot be addressed is a typed gap, never a guess. A chunk with
//     no term overlap is simply absent; nothing is invented to fill it.

/**
 * A text reduced to its WORDS AND ITS STOPS: diacritics folded, case folded,
 * every sentence-terminal run collapsed to one canonical stop, and every
 * other mark — typesetting rather than vocabulary — reduced to a word
 * boundary. Letters and numbers of any script survive; nothing else does.
 *
 * This exists because a model does not retype a source's BYTES, it retypes
 * its WORDS. The bytes of a book carry curly quotation marks, curly
 * apostrophes, em and en dashes and the ellipsis glyph; a model's retyping of
 * the same passage carries straight quotes, hyphens, three dots, and a comma
 * that drifted. Measured on War and Peace (audit 2026-08-16): a full
 * transcription of a chunk read as reproduction byte-exact and as clean prose
 * once its punctuation was straightened — across a third of the corpus, and
 * dropping the commas alone was enough on its own. A fold that stops at
 * diacritics therefore lets a photocopy pass as an answer, which is P11's own
 * lesson (one fold, applied to BOTH sides of every containment) arriving one
 * drift class later.
 *
 * The stop is the one mark that is NOT typesetting, and it is kept
 * deliberately. Where a source's sentence ENDS is the source's own structure,
 * and reproducing that boundary is what separates transcribing a passage from
 * extracting a clause out of one: an answer that lifts "Dredging of the
 * channel runs through March" and stops where the source does not has
 * selected something; an answer that runs to the source's full stop and halts
 * there has copied. Both readings are already pinned in holon.test.mjs, one
 * in each direction, and both survive this fold — which a blanket
 * punctuation strip does not (it condemns the extraction).
 *
 * The word rule is not invented here: `\p{L}\p{N}` is exactly the boundary
 * grounding.js's containment index already splits on, so the two organs read
 * "the same words" the same way. Unicode classes, not `[a-z0-9]`, because a
 * Cyrillic or CJK corpus must fold to its words and not to nothing — a fold
 * that silently emptied on another script would make the checks that use it
 * go blind rather than wrong, which is worse (II.13's own scar).
 *
 * Distinct from quotes.js's `normalizedIndex`, deliberately: that fold must
 * keep a map back to the original characters (it addresses bytes) and must
 * keep the difference between "byte equal" and "found under the fold" — that
 * difference IS its verbatim/drifted verdict. This one answers a coarser
 * question, "are these the source's words, in the source's order, to the
 * source's own stops", and can afford to shed everything else. Both stand on
 * foldDiacritics; neither is a second fold of the first's job.

 * 2026-08-18): the model must have zero idea citations are even happening,
 * let alone be able to write one. Before this, every passage shipped as
 * `[${c.ref}]\n${c.text}` with the instruction "cite the address in
 * brackets exactly as written" — handing the model a working example of
 * this instrument's own address syntax in every single prompt, then asking
 * it to reproduce one. `checkCitations` (below) could only ever verify that
 * a self-reported address EXISTED among what was offered, never that the
 * specific sentence it was stapled to was actually about that passage — a
 * model could staple any real address to any sentence and pass. The
 * correspondence is computed entirely afterward, mechanically, by
 * `attribute()` (cite.js) reading which passage's CONTENT the model's own
 * words actually overlap — the model never needs to see or write the token
 * for that to work, so it never gets the chance to fake one.
 *
 * A chunk's `identity` (identifyMaterial, above) rides ahead of its text
 * exactly the way `header` already does for a tabular chunk's column names
 * — carried beside the passage, never spliced into it, so the address it
 * came from still reads back the bytes exactly as they sit on disk. Shown
 * only when there is something worth saying (identifyMaterial returns
 * `guess: null` for ordinary prose on purpose): the measured failure this
 * closes is a model treating a fetched feed's 8 separate posts as one
 * essay because nothing anywhere said what the material actually was.
