// This is the whole path the user asked for, run over the REAL modules with
// no stub anywhere in the chain: the model's answer text → artifact.js's
// segment parse → widget.js's mechanical routing off the OPERATOR's words →
// build-log.js's append-only log over eoreader6's actual
// engine/holon/task-log.js → the projection, the cursor, the download, the
// replay. The one thing that is faked is the model, and only the model:
// every "answer" below is a literal string standing in for a turn's output,
// because what is under test is what the instrument does with an answer, not
// how it got one.
//
// The claim being pinned: "I don't like the colors" and "it's broken" land on
// the widget that already exists, as re-zeros on ITS log, and never as new
// builds — while "make me a countdown timer in python" still lands as a new
// build. Both halves matter. A router that never forks is as broken as one
// that always does; it just fails in the direction nobody notices until two
// unrelated artifacts are sharing one thread.
